Is that a pink cock ring?,['YouEnglishNotSoGood'],0,"One day we didn't have hot water (which meant the water heater stopped at least 24-38 hours prior).  I checked and the breaker was tripped.  I opened up the utility space in our apartment and did a quick once-over, didn't see anything awry.  Closed the breaker again and went back to the water heater, and heard ... something.  

Watched for a minute and saw steam coming out of the electrical junction area shown as well as spattering water (before the cover was taken off).  Went and turned the breaker off, came back and opened the junction cover to find what is shown. 

Based on the damage to the wiring, overall rust, and deterioration of other things in/around this area I suspect this has been leaking slowly into the cavity above the water heater for quite some time.  My hunch is that only recently did it evaporate enough water over time to create enough ions in the water (thereby lowering the resistance as more ions were introduced from the water source and water evaporated) such that it could pass 30+ amps and trip the breaker.

Very discomforting.  When the complex maintenance guys came in to replace the unit, they of course had a hard time getting it to train properly because the valve at the bottom was clogged with sediment/whatnot.  Flush your water heaters and check for any signs of leaks regularly (I think the recommendation is every 6 months for flushing/testing the valves including the T&amp;P valve)

I would like to add how hypocritical a lot of the critics are... They whine endlessly about the price but if Apple wasn't making a product which they value so highly why would they care? Just comes off like spiteful jealousy for a brand they would love to buy into but simply cannot afford.

"""Y'all"" exists as a grammatical rule patch. The plural of *I* is *we*. The plural of *he/she/it* is *they*. The plural of *you* is *you*, which makes NO FUCKING SENSE.

",['MasterMahan'],0,"EDIT: [Wikipedia article on the subject](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y%27all)

No.  Just no.  ""y'all"" is *never* singular.  The only situations you hear it used in the singular are when people are putting on a fake or exaggerated Southern accent, be it on tv, the radio, or real life for comedic effect.

The other possibility is that you misunderstood a plural context for a singular one.  For instance, you check into a hotel and ask for two rooms.  The clerk reasonably assumes you aren't traveling alone, and asks, ""Where y'all coming from?""  He's asking where is your *party* from, not where you in particular are from.  This is an ambiguous situation in Yankee English, and, in fact, you may have had the exact same question about your party asked in Vermont, but didn't realize the speaker was wondering about the entire group.  As a result of never having such a specific question asked of you, and defaulting to ""you"" being singular, you erroneously assumed that his use of ""y'all"" was referring to you alone.

The difference between ""y'all"" and ""all y'all"" is one of specificity.  If you're addressing a group of people and you say, ""Y'all get out of here,' you may be addressing any two or more members of that group.  On the other hand, if you say ""All y'all get out of here,"" it's quite clear that you're addressing every member of the group.

It's just like ""you"" in the plural sense, only the singular is not an option with ""y'all"".  ""You get out of here,"" can mean any number of members of the group.  ""All of you get out of here,"" obviously means everybody.

tl;dr - No, really.  ""Y'all"" is fucking *always* plural.",308,308,Netzapper,0,104

People really don't realize how much of their bodies and feelings are dependent on their hormonal balance. 

Hormone therapy isn't magic. It's all pretty mundane really. All they do is adjust the hormone levels in your body to match those of the sex you're transitioning to. Testosterone level too high? Take androgen blockers to bring it down. Estrogen levels to low? Take the same estrogen pills they give to post-menopausal women.

Just by changing the hormone balance, all the following happen:

*Your skin changes. It gets softer, any remaining acne from adolescence disappears. Body hair thins and becomes thin and clear.

*Your entire musculature changes. If you have well-developed upper body muscles like pecs or biceps, these melt away. I suppose you could keep them up with constant vigorous use, but without this they rapidly diminish

*Your fat distribution changes. It's like your body just flips a switch and says, ""oh! I should store my fat on my bust and hips/butt instead of around my midriff."" Slowly, your body fat just starts moving to a female distribution.

*Mental changes. Orgasms change. Emotions don't necessarily become more intense, but they become more visible. It's like before I was viewing them through a curtain and now they're clear as day. Consequently, it's now a lot easier to get happy or to cry.

*Breast development. Very much a YMMV thing, but it triggers the same breast development as in any other girl. It's not like the pure-fat manboobs a fat guy would get. They're the regular female breasts with all the supportive and ductile tissue. Nipples size and shape dramatically changes. They're not just for looks either. Eventually, my partner and I will have kids. I won't be able to give birth, but I'm really looking forward to being able to nurse. :3 &lt;3

Said approximation twitched as he spoke, raising one of its claws to snip at the air between them. Meredith glanced warily down at it but quickly brought her gaze back up.

""Chris..."" she started, but trailed off. Was it wise, really, to antagonise a man with a lobster in place of a fist? Probably not, but this did need to be addressed before anything else went wrong. ""Chris, I'm going to have to ask you to take a leave of absence from the transmogrification project. I have... reason to believe you've been misusing the facilities.""

Thankfully, he did. There was silence for a few moments, broken only by the clicking of tiny chitinous claws. Meredith risked another glance down, and saw that the lobster-fist had crept a few more inches across the table between them. She edged away carefully.

""Look, Chris, I'm going to file this as an accident. We'll get a team on restoring your hand, and until then you'll go on disability. How's that?""

More clicking, but slower now. Finally Chris heaved a sigh. ""I guess that's fine.""

""Excellent."" Meredith nodded sharply, gathering her papers together. ""Then how about you take the rest of the day off, and I'll get in touch with you tomorrow."" Without thinking she raised a hand to shake. Chris raised... a lobster.

They stood in silence. Meredith dropped her hand. Chris very slowly lowered his lobster.

""Er... right then,"" he muttered. ""So. Tomorrow. See you.""

People who haven't faced death always think this sounds harsh, but they don't understand and never will until they truly understand the concept of mortality.

I understand exactly what you mean about being tired. I don't think you should have to suffer through the prison of your own failing body because people who love you want to hold on to whatever scrap of you is left.

All of that said, you sound like you really love your family. I don't have a family, and my extended family and I don't get along, so I could be colored by that. When I was facing a looming death, I chose not to tell anyone. I didn't want them to influence me. Would I have made difference choice in your position? I don't think so, but it's possible. I would rather die fast and let my loved ones heal sooner, than make them watch and suffer while I slowly die. I can't imagine many things worse to do to someone I love than make them suffer at my expense, especially in a misguided attempt to avoid a harsh reality by trying to hold on to whatever scrap of me was left. 

In my experience, if you're trying to make a choice about whether you should do something or not, and it's only a choice between yes and no, you've already made your choice but haven't accepted it yet.

* The 3 main Gods and their 3 wives:
  - ""Brahma"" is the creator. ""Saraswati"" is his wife; she is the goddess of Knowledge.
  - ""Vishnu"" is the maintainer. ""Laxmi"" is his wife; she is the goddess of Wealth.
  - ""Shiva"" is the destroyer. ""Parvathi"" is his wife; she is the goddess of Power.

* All the other millions of Gods are either different forms of the main 6 Gods mentioned above, or their children, or their assistants, or their human forms. Apart from them, there are Gods for each of the elements: there are Gods responsible for Fire, Water, Wind, etc. There are Gods for everything. According to Wikipedia, Hinduism has 330 million Gods. Ha!

* The scriptures are all about the stories of the various Gods and the details of the lives they led when they had been born as humans and had led human lives. The scriptures have been known to be written by the wise old white bearded sages. It's all very well written stories; designed to teach morality and values to humans. They make amazing and frankly speaking, quite thrilling literature.

* Apart from the story based scriptures, there are scientific scriptures (like the ""vedas"") that talk about the cosmos, medicine, yoga, herbs, aviation, math, meditation and tons of other topics.

"As an engineer, the issue is size of the forces rather then whether there exist at all.

There are two components of forces on the screws holding this into the wall that add into a force vector. There is a shearing force downward on all screws equal to the total weight of the mount and TV divided by the number of screws holding to the wall (F1 = W/n). That never changes. 

The second component comes from the rotational moment (aka, torque). Above the pivot point it is pulling the screws out from the wall and, in principle below the pivot point it would push them in. The pivot point will tend to be at the bottom of the mount where it meets the wall since this is the lowest contact point stopping the mount from rotating into the wall. For simplicity, this force component on the bottom screws is essentially zero because they are more or less at the pivot point. The top screws are doing most of the torque work and the force pulling them out of the wall is essentially equal to the weight of the TV multiplied by the horizontal distance of the TV from the pivot point, divided by the distance of the top screw to the pivot point, divided by the number of top screws which we'll assume is half of them, or F2 = W*(D/d)/(n/2) = (W/n)*2*(D/d).

Hence, when close to the wall, the TV is very close to that pivot point horizontally, maybe 2 cm out from the wall, compared to the top screws being maybe 40 cm from the pivot, 2*(D/d) = 2*(2/40) = 1/10, meaning F2 is about 1/10th of F1, so most of the force on the top screws is downward with a small force pulling outward.

At 2 meters from the wall, F2 = (W/n)*2*(200cm/40cm) = (W/n)*10, meaning the force pulling the screw out of the wall is now 10 times the shear force downward (F1), which hasn't changed, and F2 is now 100 times larger than it was before. This means the force pulling the top screws out of the wall is now enormous in both absolute terms and relative to the downward shear force.

Also note that downward force is handled by the shaft of the screw. Outward force is handled by the thin threads of the screws and their contact area with the wood. It would tend to strip the screw and/or hole.

For me to feel safe with this set-up, you'd need a really big mount, lots of screws along the top, screws with big and thick threads, and into many studs in good condition.

**TL;DR: When deployed, the force pulling the screws out of the wall is on the order of 100 times larger and pulls on the thin threads of the screws.**",['DashingLeech'],0,"As not an engineer, this also happens when the TV is at any distance from the wall.",48,48,Mugros,0,112

Did you take the keys?",['Dead_Rooster'],0,"I'm gonna be posting updates here.

**NOTE**: I'm not bashing peyote. I don't think she uses it a lot. She's just crazy. Sorry for the misleading title.

Apparently, my mom and her friend have been emailing back and forth since I forwarded this first one to my mom. Should I post the convo? It gets pretty fucking hilarious.

**UPDATE 1**: I guess my mom got in her face, here's her response ([K] is me):


&gt;[K's mom],
&gt;
&gt;I knew what had happened to the keys the day they went missing. I also knew that you will always defend [K] at any cost, no matter what the situation and that's why I held my tongue. Experience has taught me that it is useless to talk to you when you get in that place- you take everything SO personally and get so defensive immediately at any perceived slight or mis-communication.
&gt;
&gt;I have consulted with my dear friend and healer. She is a Christian and reads only for people who have the highest aims in their requests. I told her nothing about the circumstances of my loss, only that I needed to know if my own psychic revelation was accurate.  I knew exactly  what has happened. I have caught [K] in lies before so this is nothing new. I do not believe anything he says now. He has destroyed any kind of tenderness I have ever known for him. 
&gt;
&gt;The gift of seeing beyond the earth plane has not always be fun; knowing the truth only made the rest of my stay there kind of depressing. It was a hard for me to drive all that way at night with my deteriorating eyesight and it was hard on [husband] for me to take a whole week of vacation away from helping him around here. Then I had to stay longer and he had to take another unpaid day off of work while I returned. 
&gt;We certainly paid dearly for that trip. How do you think all that feels to us? It is really awful how I have stuffed my pain and anger for months now. I also have anger at my self for not acting on my knowing at the time of the incident, but maybe that is a part of my learning. 
&gt;
&gt;My friend's reading was so accurate, it was complete  confirmation of my own insights. She asked me why you would be involved because you were in the situation but not directly involved with the keys going missing. Then she described [K] in detail and even his mindset at the time. I will spare you further details. He needs to talk to you and explain, but I doubt he will.
&gt;
&gt;It breaks my heart that his anger and hatefulness spills over into doing such horrible acts. I have not harmed him at any time but when I saw his anger at me over not giving him all the alcohol he wanted, I knew he had a serious problem. 
&gt;
&gt;I only want my keys back. He can hide them somewhere where you will find them. I don't care about the circumstances, but I sure can't afford to replace them at this time. 
&gt;
&gt;You allow and encourage him to live the playboy lifestyle despite your own knowing that he is using you and your finances. You have loving friends all around who would not harm you, yet you allow him to remain in your home and bring in this awful spirit of greed and entitlement. 
&gt;It makes me sad for you. 
&gt;
&gt;I am angry that [K] thinks so little of me after our familial connections for all of our lives. But of course, he thinks of no one but himself and my prayers are that he changes someday. 
&gt;
&gt;[Husband] and I are both offended by this theft.  Our relationships are all on thin ice because of him. I cannot tolerate being ripped off by someone who has all the protections and assurances he needs so he can continue in his corrupt ways. [K's dad] would be so broken to see this- I know his soul is tortured to see [K] destroying the relationships that are positive in your life. 
&gt;
&gt;I am waiting for the keys to be returned. I won't want to see [K] again unless he returns the keys and apologizes for the offense. It has been so cruel of him to disturb my sleep,(and your sleep) my peace of mind, (and your peace of mind) and to inconvenience me so that I have to go without the electronic opener for the car and trunk. Every time I drive the car I am reminded of his extreme callousness and cruelty. 
&gt;
&gt;I am very sorry you can't see what I can see...but if you don't trust me, it is not because of anything I say or do.
&gt;
&gt;I HATE to make any accusation falsely so I have waited and waited to say anything. Your home has not exactly been the best place to send a sheriff's deputy for numerous reasons. Then here came the holidays, and I didn't want to spoil them for you. [K] has been a butt to you for so long, I knew he would disappoint you at Christmas and your birthday. I am angry at him for that too. How selfish, how uncaring, how disrespectful of his mother...why you tolerate his behaviors is beyond my understanding. He is the only person he thinks of so I made sure that you would have some gifts during the holidays and remembrances for your birthday to help distract you from the reality of things.  
&gt;
&gt;I only want you to have happiness and peace in your life. I can't give you that though...so care for yourself as best you can. [K] couldn't care less and will only continue to take everthing he can from you, so I pray someone else enters your life to show you how you deserve to be loved.

"AND HE TURNED OUT TO BE YOUR DRILL SARGENT, GOOD LUCK CADET.",['AcidicToast'],0,"When I was 17, my friend and I were walking down the street near my house at about 1:00 am. We lived in dense neighborhood dominated by three decker houses. We came around a corner to see this huge bull sized man on his knees, over a woman. He was furiously smashing her head into the concrete sidewalk. When I say this guy was bull sized, I mean he was not fat. His muscles had muscles and they were bulging. He reminded me of the Hulk. Only, he was not green. He was red. Red as if he was in heatstroke. We screamed at him right away. 

He looked up, and I will never forget that face. There was snot pouring out of his nose. Long strands of it hung all the way down to the woman's head. His eyes were bright white, crazed, wide, and far too circular. His face expressed a murderous fury I have never seen before, and hope I never see again. 

He lifted the woman's head by her hair, and with a loud ""crack"" spiked it into the cement like a football, and screamed ""you want some of this huh!"" I had not seen my friend pick up the rock he had, but he threw at the guys snarling face. He hit him right in the nose. It was a big ass rock, but it did not even phase the guy.

They guy lunged at my friend, who took of running. They guy took off chasing my friend. I knew there was no way a guy that size would be able to catch up to my buddy who was a track and field athlete. I ran to the woman. 

Her hair was completely matted, and Dark red blood was gushing from a huge deep gash across her forehead. I could not believe she was not unconscious. I tried to tell her I was here to help and she became combative. She started punching me screaming to leave her man alone. I was afraid that her screaming would bring that monster back to us.

With that thought I said ""fuck this"" to myself and I grabbed her wrists and dragged her to the nearest door and started pounding on it. This time it was me screaming ""open the fuck up!"" I was scared shitles that this guy would be back before I got to someplace safe.

Two men opened the door and pretty much freaked out when they saw that I was restraining a small woman covered in blood. I think they were about to take me out, but I screamed ""call the police! Call an ambulance!"" I told them that we needed to get in before he comes back. I told them ""He WILL come back!""

We quickly dragged the woman into the hallway, shut, and locked the door. One of the guys called the police and they showed up in what seemed like seconds. An ambulance arrived soon after. 

My buddy, seeing the lights of the squad cars, returned to the scene. He out ran the guy, and got to a store and had the clerk call the police. So I guess they were already on the way before we made the call.

The police had allot of questions of course. We had no idea who the guy was. We never saw him or the woman before. In the end the police gave us a card and said that if we see this guy again, call 911 right away. Like I would even hesitate. 

The next day, the events of the night before were in the paper. I read the article sitting on my porch. It said that the woman was in critical condition. It mentioned my name as well as my buddy. It also said that the man was yet to be identified, and was yet to be apprehended. Here is the part that really messed with my head. The place where this happened was one block away from my porch. I looked up and could see the spot where he was smashing her head. I remember thinking ""That fucker is still out there!"" and looking down at the paper ""he knows my name.""

Two weeks later I turned 18, and I was on a plane to boot camp. This guy scared me THAT much. ",294,294,linesallover,0,137

http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/lso90/majority_of_sex_workers_not_forced_or_trafficked/c2vaza3 :

Illegal prostitution isn't about safety, it's about controlling male sexuality. Sex workers and their customers are MUCH safer in a legal and regulated environment. It is made illegal to limit male options for sexual gratification.
It's all about economics. When a resource is limited in availability, it comes at a higher price. A large pillar of our societal status quo is the phenomenon of men busting their asses in order to provide for a woman (his wife or LTR) who in turn provides (often inadequate) sexual release.
If a man can visit his local brothel and procure reasonably safe and anonymous company for a fair price, it makes it much more difficult for regular women to obtain a man's resources. Which means that all the economic sectors that profit from women lose access to male wealth.
Crusaders against prostitution do not care about the safety of women. They only care about maintaining the pussy cartel.

http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/mvuxm/insight_from_a_male_friend_on_facebook/c349s6v

At one time, this was a valuable trade. After courting and the wedding, she stayed at home and raised the children and tended the house while you went out and busted your ass to bring home the bacon. You had sex far more often and were treated with more respect. This isn't reserved for any guy. He had to do his part.
Women went to school to do all these things properly and be ""real ladies"" while men went to school to learn how to be ""real men."" Women were the experts in their roles and men were in theirs. A young woman busts her ass through these trainings for what? The first random guy that comes around? Fuck that! She wants to ensure that he's worth all this crap for. He better provide for her. He better be fucking grateful for all this. It was a symbiotic relationship, however since the man wouldn't marry any woman because the relationship falls apart and something gives (kids raised badly, for example). They needed each other to get this family-thing to work.
Obviously, we don't live in this society anymore nor would I want to where roles are determined by gender. However, women tore up their side of this contract yet demand men to keep up their side.
We should be grateful and make sure we're good providers. For what exactly? A marriage that ends the minute she gets bored while you lose your house, your kids, and a sizeable chunk of your income for the next 18 years?
I'm not saying women should be forced back ""in their place."" I'm just saying that her attitude about her worth is based on a dead age in society.

In short, unrestrained female hypergamy is the downfall of society. It lets women reproduce at will with alphas, the minority of society, and causes the majority of men to become disenfranchised and stop producing labor and innovations. In other words, society NEEDS women ""doing their part"" of ensuring sexual access to the myriad of beta men (majority of society) who build, maintain, protect, and advance society, as well as take out their trash. Marriage and the nuclear family unit was the bedrock foundation of society for generations, because without women playing their part then men have little to no incentive to do theirs. The result of which is social collapse. And we cannot expect women to pick up the slack when it comes to having their ""fair share"" of the glass cellar. Women, at least in the here and now, are patently refusing to accept that kind of work. Thus, civilization cannot afford men to become disenfranchised by lack of sexual access else they check out and stop contributing.",['diesuke'],0,"http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/kpcyb/an_overview_of_feminism_from_concept_to_theory_to/c2m3heu

I think you have a really good point here. Feminism never would have succeeded without the good will of men, if the patriarchy was as established as it was made out to be. But, I think that good will is definitely fading fast.

Looks more like a textbook case of a male narrowly avoiding serious prison time because the female is unable to hold herself accountable or be held accountable for her own poor choices. Even if it was true that 'she really wouldn't have had sex with him if she was sober', how could he or anybody else know that? Especially if for instance she said otherwise, was begging for his dick, or had her hands or head down his pants at the time?

Why would they need a discount on taxes? If they are getting paid less then men (in the giant anti-female conspiracy that doesn't involve experience or different negotiation strategies), they are paying less taxes.
Utility Bills? Stop wasting utilities and your rates go down. If you're paid less, then live within your fucking means. If you live in an apartment complex that divides utilities evenly, then would everyone get the discount or do you expect men (as always) to subsidize you? What if you live with a man and the bill is under your name? That would be unfair if a MAN took advantage of this wouldn't it.
Medical Insurance? Please. We're having this same issue in the states. If women use more resources, why shouldn't they pay for it?
Edit: Notice how, in the article, the author handwaves any reasonable explanation of a pay gap away in favor of some vast anti-female conspiracy.

Every step forward feminism makes, is a step toward its own demise.
It can not be far away that social commentators put 2+2 together and realize the true nature of the roots of war and conflict in society.
What part did women and 'feminism' play in the Nazi rise for instance?
Well Germany at the time of the Nazi rise, observed the British and its trade routes around the world and thought 'we would like that for ourselves', and so via a small group of mad, power-hungry men, the figurehead being Hitler, and the women of Germany sent their men out across europe to get it.
Hitler didnt speak to the men of Germany, he spoke to the women, because he knew that if he got the women on his side, men would do as they were expected. But Hitler didnt stop with women, he also created the Nazi youth, because he knew men would never go against women and children.
Why did the British themselves go out into the world for these trade routes? because British women demanded it. Women demand resources, and send their men out to kill and be killed to get them.
So female influence can be seen right at the very root of conflict and past wars, but its been done under false names and ideologies.
Its the same reason the US and the UK are currently in Iraq. We are there to keep the region unstable and to secure the oil supply. Why is oil important? because oil is needed to produce luxury goods. Which sex consumes luxury goods far out weighing the other? women.
If now, feminism has become so powerful in its own right that its brazenly displaying its war-like nature and intentions under its own name, that should show people the true nature of 'feminism', and why it may be the driver of human conflict on a global scale. The problem is, it may be too late to stop it doing immense damage. I rather suspect that to be the case.

SO HE *STILL* HANGS OUT WITH THESE DARK ARTS FANATICS (BECAUSE HE'S ALSO FASCINATED BY THE DARK ARTS) AND WHEN LILY DEFENDS HIM IN PUBLIC (HOW *DARE* SHE) HE GETS BUTTHURT AND CALLS HER A MUDBLOOD. THIS IS THE GIRL HE WAS SUPPOSEDLY BEST FRIENDS WITH FOR YEARS. A LOT OF PEOPLE STRUGGLE WITH PEER PRESSURE, BUT THESE COOL KIDS AREN'T JUST SMOKING CIGARETTES BEHIND THE FENCE, THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT BLOOD PURITY AND CLEANSING THE WIZARDING WORLD AND ABUSING MUGGLES AND SHIT, AND SNAPE GOES ""YEAH, YOU GUYS ARE MY TRUE FRIENDS.""

AND THEN LATER HE JOINS THE DEATH EATERS AND DOES VOLDEMORT'S DIRTY WORK AND TELLS HIM ABOUT THE PROPHECY. IT'S ONLY AFTER VOLDEMORT DECIDES THE PROPHECY REFERS TO HIS CHILDHOOD CRUSH THAT SNAPE IS LIKE ""OH SHIT, NO WAIT, DON'T KILL HER."" IF IT HAD BEEN ANYONE ELSE SNAPE WOULD HAVE BEEN ALL ABOARD THE MURDER TRAIN BECAUSE HE WAS A HUGE DICK.

AND THEN AFTER HE JOINS TEAM DUMBLEDORE AND FRIENDS HE'S STILL A COMPLETE JACKASS TO THE GRYFFINDOR KIDS (FUCKING PICKING ON NEVILLE, AN 11 YEAR OLD BOY WITH SELF-ESTEEM ISSUES, WHEN SNAPE IS A GROWN-ASS MAN), ALONG WITH THE REALLY TWISTED ATTITUDE HE HAS TOWARD HARRY, WHO PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE HATED SNAPE IF SNAPE HADN'T CONSTANTLY CHEWED HIM OUT.

HE DOES BECOME A TRAGIC HERO, BUT HIS SITUATION ISN'T BAD LUCK OR CRUELTY OF FATE AS MUCH AS IT'S HIS OWN SHITTY DECISIONS.

Think about this.
2000 years ago if you would have told someone that a little tadpole that you can't see with the naked eye goes all jackhammer on a pearl and it sprouts appendages to become a child they would have looked at you like a damn moron.

"&gt; Seeing how the label as a hate group is nothing but social criticism, and not a ""punishment"", no it isnt antithetical to the amendment. 

True. However, usually the argument that something is ""hate speech"" goes hand in hand with the argument that it should not be encompassed under ""free speech"" and therefore subject to punishment. 

&gt; The first amendment is not so much about ""free speech"" (that is, you are protected from all social repercussions of a decision, or censorship from a private party, as reddit likes to define free speech) as it is preventing the GOVERNMENT from restricting your speech. Nothing more, to say that it is more is to apply subjective ideals which do not have basis in law. They can call a group a hate group because they want to, just like you can them radical trannies, if you wanted to (not saying you do). The first amendment has zero application here.

There are many Supreme Court cases that reference the Marketplace of Ideas and the philosophy upon which the First Amendment is founded. 

It is true that the First Amendment only prevents government restrictions, but people who protest to shut down other people's speech, even though they are not government affiliated, do not believe very strongly in the principles underlying the Amendment.

"I worked at a Sony Store in my youth and by the end, I could sniff out a stolen credit card pretty quickly. The sale was just too easy. 

Customer: I need a new TV

Me: Oh, okay, what size?

Cust: What's your best unit? (alarm bells start to lightly dingle)

Me: Well, we have this uber XBR super expensive one here. That's our best unit.

Cust: Perfect, I'll take it. (alarm bells are going harder now)

Me: Great! Would you also like the 4 years of extra warranty?

Cust: Hell yes, get it in there! (alarm bells are gonging now)

So, we get to the till... And when we suspected someone, would say for purchases over a certain amount we had to call VISA for preauth. There's a code you can say to trip a ""silent alarm"" for VISA, where they ask to speak with the client. VISA Sometimes did that anyway, but not always. It's like a code 11 or something. Anyway... I pass the phone to the guy and he tells them a bunch of information. I get the phone back, after they put him on hold... I get it back after they come back on the line, and they tell me to cut it up. Turns out, they tried the cardholders home line and talked to the client who was supposed to be in our store. I went to the back room, called security and had him hauled out. I also got a $100 prepaid VISA from VISA itself for thwarting a fraud!",['ssign'],0,"My first manager position with a paint store chain in podunk, Arkansas. Had less than 10 customers a day most days so the store was spotless, all shelves perfectly fronted. See scroungy guy coming to store from across street. Actually kind of excited to have a customer. Enters store, I greet him, he replies stopped just inside doorway looking at me. Totally sizing me up. (Guess I was radiating easy mark.) Walks up to the nearest aisle and takes a gallon of exterior latex primer off the shelf. Carries it up to the counter and says he'd like to return it and get his money back. I smile at his boldness and ask for the receipt. We go through the whole deception, I casually mention that I have few sales every day and usually remember them, not to mention the fact I would have definitely remembered selling an exterior waterborne product in the middle of winter. He sticks with his story, says he got it from the other guy (my asst mgr) and asked if he was here. (Asst Mgr is a pushover and probably would have returned it just to avoid the confrontation.)

Ok. I walk him over to the shelf where I point to the glaring hole where this particular gallon just came from. I was laughing at this point. I told him, no receipt, no deal. So I could see him thinking something through at this point. He finally changed his story and said he was only teasing and instead wanted to buy some paint. So he gathers about $25 of supplies and again, just grabs the nearest gallon of paint of another shelf. (It wasn't even paint.) Asks, can I return this stuff if I don't use it all? (Here we go.)

At this point I'm tired of him and just want him out of the store, but if he's going to pay, hell, I'll take a sale. Whips out a checkbook, a surprise in itself, as if this guy had a bank account, I would have been astounded. Checks are in the name of Mrs. Something Something. I ask for ID, he has none. He says, Oh yeah, Mrs. Something asked me to come get this stuff and said to use her checks to pay for it. Oh cool, I told him, then she won't mind us calling her to confirm the amount! No, no, he says, she's probably napping, she's old and sleeps a lot. Well I told him, this is what I'm going to do. I'll keep her checkbook and all of the supplies and as soon as I hear from her, you can come get them, ok? This was not ok. Ranting and raving and threats ensued. I escorted him out of the store and called the police. They came and got the checkbook and arrested him later. Old lady had been burgled by him earlier in the day and didn't realize her checkbook was missing. She was grateful and very nice.

CITATION, Liz!!!",['DigitalEvil'],0,"This happened to me and my friend. We both lived in a very shitty neighborhood that had a huge forest directly behind it. We were always too scared to go inside the forest, but one day we decided if we went together we'd be fine. We're about ten minutes in when this short, ginger haired guy jumps out in front of us. He was scary as shit just by his appearance. He was very short, mid twenties, had a little red beard, wore a big green coat covered in holes and (now what I know is) dried blood, ripped jeans covered in mud, and huge black boots. He stared at us for a minute then smiled the most creepiest smile I've ever seen. 

He said ""Hey little girls, why don't you come over here? I have some toys you can play with."" We backed away, we were both terrified. He then took out a ten inch fucking knife (which had blood stains on it), and started walking towards us. He lunged at us and we fled in different directions. He chased her instead of me and I could hear her screaming all the way down the street out of the woods. He didn't chase her for long as it was during the day, and a lot of people were outside. It was the scariest moment in my childhood.

As a kid, I always thought he was just going to *kidnap* me, but over the years I realized he could have easily torn me apart. Also, they tore the forest down two years later, and found over a dozen corpses in it buried or lying about.

Edit- When I say short I mean he was only like 5'2''-5'4'' not like *really* short. Also, this forest was next to one of the worst apartment complex in the city where I live where there are tons of drugs deals and such. He couldn't have possibly killed all those people or it would have made bigger news. This happened over ten years ago, I tried to find a article on it, but I could only come up with news from San Antonio. :/

I texted her and told her what's been going on and she said she has been waiting for me to breakup with this girl so she could ask me out. This is a girl I've liked since high school but we've always been in relationships. 

Things work out for the best. I really do believe karma plays into things. I've never said hurtful things to this girl and I've always been then 'bigger person' and just walked away, but I can only take so much. ",788,788,[deleted],0,229

"The problem with this point of view is that it assumes each country will follow the same path from pre-industrial&gt;industrial&gt;post industrial. 

This is not the case, the world now is different from when the U.S, the UK etc were going through their developmental periods. The world has been shaped by the countries that got there first, wars, internal change in nations. It's essentialist and pretty narrow to think that to develop (if we can even us that as a general term), means going through step 1, step , 2, step 3. Nations in Africa tried this through import substitution industrialization, the same process that the U.S went through. Which means an economy is supported by replacing imported goods with domestic products according to their capacity, then exporting them for purchase and consuming them domestically. What happened is that the domestic products were far inferior to the imported goods they meant to replace, and government programs to encourage domestic production got swallowed up by corrupt officials, lack of scaling abilities, and generally poor handling. In addition, countries were exporting raw materials, extracted resources, and then having to buy back value added good made of those same materials. A catch 22 as the result of a global economy run by those who already ""made it"".

Reaching higher levels of GDP, technological capacity, human capital, is far more complicated than following a set of steps that we would call ""development"". If it was that simple everyone would be doing it already.

",['number676766'],0,"I don't see too much wrong with this. This is what every industrialized nation has gone through at some point in its development.

The next generation will reap the rewards of the labor of these men, and so on. No one has a gun to these guys heads, they are smiling and laughing. They are making money, not starving to death in a field somewhere laying in their own shit. 

In a perfect world, a society could skip this portion of development.

Overall it was a good experience, and for free you couldn't beat it, but I thought it could be improved in some areas.

1) Not being able to edit the title of the ad campaign was disappointing. Halfway though I noticed that my ad was getting a negative karma rating, and asked why. People told me my ad title was not as clear as it could have been, which was of course my own fault, but I had no seeming way to rectify it: I could create a new campaign, but I believe that would have costed money.  I could edit the post, but if the title was misleading, there was no way to fix that.

2) I wish there was a way to target multiple subreddits, without being site wide. My job ad applied to subreddits like /r/machinelearning and /r/programming among others, but I had to create a separate campaign  for each subreddits, which I believe would have costed money (since I believe only one campaign was free). 

3) KrispyKrackers was great in getting in contact with me and telling me what to do. I got set up easily and it was a smooth process throughout, despite the caveats above.

4) The stats pages were great and really helped me get an idea how many people were clicking, etc.


Overall, I would probably use the service again, but I admit my post was not a successful one. I had a CTR of 0.35%, but no actual responses to my job posting. I blame this on my own ad posting skills though, rather than on anything Reddit did. Once I scrounge up a bit of money, I'll try again :)

So while it's awful seeing what some players have done recently, in my mind the NFL has no responsibility and I have no expectations of them. That's the law's job. If they prosecute, great. If they don't, they probably didn't have enough evidence. 
But when teams start cheating (don't care if it was a blowout, breaking league rules to gain an advantage is cheating no matter how you spin it), it ruins the game. And the GAME is the only reason I care about the NFL. So you can try to downplay this because of the comparison to more awful things, and I won't argue.

NOW (again the Largest femi org in america) is against boy only schools because ""they increase sexism and exacerbate feelings of superiority toward women."" Sad that I dont have to make s**t like this up.

Many more examples of feminist hate can be found in Christina Hoff Sommers two best selling books - ""Who Stole Feminism"" and ""The War Against Boys"".

So no offense but I am not interested in the kind of ""help"" feminist would like to give. And also I have yet to see of one example of modern feminists campaining for a valid mens rights issue (in fact its usually the opposite with feminists campaining against an MRA issue) and that alone says something about the movement in general.",76,76,MattClark0994,0,-14

"PROBABLY SLOWLY GROWING. I HAVE NO CLUE WHY THESE GUYS ARE SO MAD SEEMINGLY. I AM NOT SPEAKING DOOM ON WOW, NOT CROWNING GW2 THE MMO KING. JUST POINTING OUT WHAT APPEARS TO BE A GOOD TREND.
",['-Fony-'],0,"I run a guild for a 3rd party website community. A typical WoW release would have around 50 people playing primetime at launch, leveling out around 20 people in the weeks following. Usually we'd have around 100 active members, x 2 guild (alliance and horde).

Well, GW2 has brought out a huge new swath of people we didn't expect. We were anticipating similar numbers, but we got 200+ unique players. We have 50 people simultaneously online 5 weeks after launch in prime time. And the corollary is that while the WoW guilds are doing fine post MOP, they've seen significant drops in participation.

In short, GW2 has picked up some people who are WoW exiles, but also appeals to different types of players -- non raiders, people who prefer more arcade style play vs methodical hotkey, and people who refuse to pay monhtly subs. 

I think GW2's population is growing, most likely through word of mouth. VGchartz shows GW2 @ more than 1m retail copies sold, and I know of NO ONE who bought the boxed copy. My guess is digital sales are 2:1 to 3:1...which would put GW2 as the 2nd highest selling PC game this year after Diablo 3. ",2,2,dbcanuck,0,-7

"&GT;RINGS AROUND THINGS ARE NOT INHERENTLY STABLE

YEAH, TELL ME ABOUT IT, MY BEST FRIEND'S FIANCE IS A FUCKING NIGHTMARE. 

HEYOOOOOOOOO I'LL GET MY COAT. ",['narngle'],0,"Rings around things are not inherently stable.  That is, they would stay in position if they were perfectly centered and neither of them ever moved.  Give it a *slight* nudge, from the moon or sun's gravity, though, and it's off centered.  As soon as it's off center, the earth would have a non-zero gravitational attraction to the ring.  It would start to pull more on the closer side, and eventually they would touch.  Look up analysis of the stability of Larry Niven's Ringworld for an analysis of people with a  better grasp of orbital mechanics than I.  Rings around planets like saturn are different, because they aren't constructed of a single piece. They aren't real rings, they are multiple tiny satellites. 

EDIT:  People have asked me the same few questions like 100 times, so I'll answer the big ones:

1. No, it doesn't matter if the ring is rotating.  Gyroscopic stabilization doesn't work for translation in the plane of the ring, which is what we are talking about.  If gyroscopic stabilization worked that way, bicycles wouldn't be able to move.

2. No, the forces don't cancel, so it's not stable.  The case of forces canceling for a gravitational body inside a sphere only works out for spheres, not for a ring.  Rings are stable along the axis of rotation, so you could move the earth up or down within the ring and it would return to equilibrium, but they are not stable with a gravitational body in middle of the ring.  It will attract the closer side of the ring more than the side further away.  It's because a ring is practically 1 dimensional from the perspective of the earth, while a sphere is fully two dimensional.  That means that the apparent area doesn't scale with the square of the distance any more, like gravitational attraction does.

In one of the comments diredyre put it a slightly different way, if this helps:
&gt;The relation of the close part of a ring vs the far part is linear while in a Dyson sphere it's quadratic. If 1 meter on the close part of a ring corresponds to 2 meters on the far part, then the analog of the Dyson sphere would be 1x1 meter on the close part and 2x2 meters on the far part, so 1m² to 4m². So obviously the same conclusions don't apply anymore and the ring is unstable.",1600,1600,czyivn,0,2008

My hypothesis based on this (which is basically what you said as well) is that the super-massive black holes in the centers of galaxies over time grow so massive that they eventually contact other supermassive black holes in a parallel and equally matured universe, thus creating a brand new Big Bang elsewhere in another dimension.   It could be a way the universe ""seeds"" itself with it's inevitable doom from the ""Big Rip"" caused by Dark Energy's exponential expansion.

"First experiment describes the Ph of some plastic bags moored in a fjord in Norway, where the CO2 levels were artificially changed. It has nothing to do with actual measurements of seawater Ph as a result by alleged increases in disolved Co2 from man-made Co2 emissions; and there is no correlation with any measured decline in reefs.

Second study is a review of earlier studies, and the experiments under review do not include any evidence of measured, real-world coral decline correlated to measured, real-world seawater Ph changes.

Third study is a broken link. GG.

Fourth is one I've read before, from _1989_, describing a now discredited link between the mass bleaching event of the late 1980s and early 1990s that has now been established to be the result not of global warming, but of warm surface waters caused by the El Nino oscillation. In fact, it was this discovery that spurred the new scare: ten years ago, bleaching was blamed on global warming, but that's now known not to be the case. So instead certain researchers (mainly linked to groups like the WWF) have latched onto decreased Ph as a possible linkage to global warming, thereby securing their funding.

So: despite your shotgun efforts and your pretentious assertion that you have the faintest fucking clue what you're talking about, you still don't have a valid correlation between real (measured) seawater Ph and a (measured) decline in coral reefs. 

Are you really interested in the science, or just the warm glow you get from pretending you know what you are talking about?",['DataGeneral'],0,"&gt; Opinion? Not science then?

You'd prefer I use 'consensus' or 'prominent, upcoming theory in the field'? Fine by me.

&gt; Can you specify the current changes in Ph and salinity you are talking about? Because up until now, there are no such measurements.

The first sentence of [this](http://infohost.nmt.edu/~chem/wingenter/Wingenter_PeECE_III_GRL_2007.pdf) article on CO2, pH, bioproductivity, and climate feedbacks grants your request for *current* change in pH. Salinity shouldn't have been included in my list. My bad.

&gt; In fact - this particular sphere of study is undergoing a rebirth of funding courtesty of Gullible Warming, and so has created a scare to drive the funding. There are many headline-grabbing stories of the decline of coral reefs based on decreased alkalinity of sea-water, but these effects have not been established by any measurements of seawater Ph, or any corellated decline in the condition of coral reefs.

Again, [science](http://www.springerlink.com/content/r0v66mp4313u7134/) begs to differ.

"We can look at it in a multitude of ways:

Economic:  It costs a parent about 200K to raise a kid from child to adult, they invest in that child.  Society invests in a person as well. We develop infrastructure to educate you, raise you, train you. Much of our taxes go to help care for you and turn you into a productive member of the human race. Even people without kids pay taxes to help raise kids, we as a society raise and train people, we invest in each other and depend on each other.  It may be hard to see because of the complexity of our world now but simplify it, if we were a tribe living in a cave...you were trained to be a hunter...we barely eat enough as it is...you get sad and kill yourself...now other people may starve because of you. The modern world FEELS different but it isn't, the scale is just bigger.

Emotional: Humans are social creatures.  We depend on social interaction for personal fulfillment, we pair bond.  Again, we depend on each other for strength and support. If a child looses a parent to suicide that child will be fucked for life.  Likewise, a parent, a friend a lover.

I have no problem with anyone who has been or is a hawks fan. You like who you like.

But don't sit here and write up a bunch of bullshit about your team. No one gave a fuck about the Hawks in this area, and I have lived here for around 10 years, until they started winning.

You're right, we don't rep the Hawks *at all* except when they're doing well. That's why the Clink/Qwest and the Kingdome are and were always regarded as some of the loudest stadiums to date. That's why the 12th man has been a thing in Seattle since 1984 and before even though we were fucking terrible back then (I'm not saying it was our original idea, of course Texas A&amp;M and dozens of other college teams used it before us).

Straight up disrespect for a team that's finally smelling success, like us 12s are supposed to be ashamed that we're finally winning? Easy to say coming from a storied franchise that's never seen a cellar.

"One major difference between the USA and Greece is that the USA has retained the power to devalue its currency as a means to responding to overwhelming debt - something Greece gave up when it joined the Euro. This also has an even greater detrimental effect because if the rest of the Eurozone, such as Germany or France, does well, is actually makes Greek debt even **harder** to pay off because their currency will gain value, even as their own economy shrinks!

EDIT: Grammar",['m4nu'],0,"The United States probably won't ever completely be debt free. We've had debt [since 1791](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_public_debt#History) (edit: except for one year under Andrew Jackson). We were once on track to become debt free! But that was [under Clinton](http://factcheck.org/2008/02/the-budget-and-deficit-under-clinton/) and changed once George W. Bush took office. [This](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_external_debt) and [this](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2079rank.html) list only 3-4 countries which don't have debt. A government having a debt is *much more complex* than a household or a person having a debt.

It's not as simple as ""debt = bad"" or ""when a person is in debt they're trying to pay it off, so when a country is in debt they're trying to pay it off"". It's also not as simple as ""debt is good in all circumstances"".

&gt; When will that come back and bite them in the ass

When and if. And the answer is: no one knows either answer with certainty.

If you want an example of what you're describing, look up the crisis in Greece. [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_government_debt_crisis) is the wikipedia page, using a search engine (and possibly the search button here) will be beneficial. What basically happened is:

1. Greece had a lot of debt.
2. Investors thought Greece wouldn't be able to repay them if they loaned Greece money.
3. Consequently, investors either stopped loaning money to Greece or made Greece pay a lot to borrow. (Think of the difference between being loaned $100 and having to repay $105 in one year, versus being loaned $100 and having to repay $200 in one year. Check out [this](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/government-bond-yield) article for a graphical representation, change the date on the interactive graph to display since 1998.)
4. As a result, Greece couldn't borrow money.
5. Because Greece couldn't borrow money (because people thought they wouldn't be able to repay it) Greece couldn't repay the people who had already loaned them money.
6. Greece institutes austerity measures (the government spends less).
7. Because the government is spending less, the economy suffers.
8. Because the economy is suffering the government has less money to spend.
9. Because the government has less money to spend - which makes it even more difficult/expensive to borrow money - borrowing more gets even more expensive requiring spending even less.
10. Repeat in a vicious cycle.
11. Solution: ???

There are proposed solutions but none terribly attractive; there's no good resolution.

If you're wondering how similar the United States is to Greece, we need to depend on economists telling us the answer. Unfortunately, there's no way to quantify everything that goes into the answer. For example, there's no magic number we can apply to food stamps to get ""the right level"", there's no magic number we can apply to the tax code to get ""the right taxes"". So a lot of what economists tell us is is descriptive rather than prescriptive.

-------------------------

[Here](http://www.everything2.com/title/Descriptive+and+Prescriptive+Philosophy+of+Science) is a link clarifying one use of the term ""descriptive and prescriptive"" [here](http://grammar.about.com/od/basicsentencegrammar/a/grammarintro.htm) is another article talking about a different use of the term.

What I mean is that economists can tell us ""if you do X, Y will probably happen"". They can say ""if you raise the top tax bracket by 2%, here are the probable results"" or ""if you change the requirements for food stamps to allow more people to qualify, here are the probable results"". Economists can't tell us what a fair tax code looks like or to what extent the social safety net could look like.

They can describe, they (outside of things like ""optimal levels"") can't prescribe.

--------------------------------

We know we're not in the advanced stages of the vicious cycle I alluded to. The USD (US Dollar) is the world's [reserve currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#United_States_dollar) for now. We can still borrow money very cheaply which means that ""the market"" trusts us to be able to repay.

Does that mean ""this is proof the United States is nothing like Greece!"" or does it mean ""this is proof the United States is about to be just like Greece!""? I don't know.

If you tend to trust liberal economists then you'll come to the conclusion that we're totally safe. One analogy they use is a boat (the government) crossing an ocean (debt). If the boat is strong enough then the depth of the ocean (debt) is irrelevant.

If you tend to trust conservative/libertarian economists then you'll come to the conclusion that we're in immediate danger. I don't, so I'm unfamiliar with any analogies they might use.

------------------------

[This](http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2011/10/21/141510617/what-if-we-paid-off-the-debt-the-secret-government-report) is mostly trivia rather than anything useful to understanding the concept. But it's the best kind of trivia: related!

It turns out that the United States completely paying off its debt would produce difficulties in the global financial market. The United States Treasury Bonds (the thing the government ""sells"" to borrow money) is incredibly tied in with the global financial market. So if we stopped being in debt there would be no more Treasury bonds and it would cause quite a kerfuffle. That's not to say we shouldn't (or that we should) but it's interesting to realize how interconnected economics can be, and how wrongheaded it is to say:

&gt; You wouldn't let your household go in debt would you? No! Household debt is bad. Government debt is the exact same concept but on a bigger scale. Ergo government debt = bad.

They're incredibly different things.

edits: Thanks for the great response y'all!

1)

Warning: you're about to experience [semantic satiation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_satiation) with the word Clinton.

I threw in the bit about being on our way to being debt free under Clinton as a last minute edit and didn't think about how it might be interpreted. I'll try to clarify what I mean, and why I feel it's accurate. It seems pretty obvious upon reflection that I didn't take much care in being precise because A) I was tired and not as careful as I could have been and B) my bias as a liberal which, like most biases, meant I was used to being able to use shorthand and still communicate clearly with like-minded people. People in an in-group/community can say certain things and have it be clearly understood by other members, whereas if we say the same thing to people outside our group it carries an entirely different meaning.

When I say we were on our way to being debt free under Clinton, I mean that [depending on the measure one uses](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/23/bill-clinton/bill-clinton-says-his-administration-paid-down-deb/) the debt decreased. I didn't mean:

* We were on our way to being debt free under Clinton and the only reason was Clinton's brilliant policies
* We were on our way to being debt free under Clinton therefore suck it Republicans
* We were on our way to being debt free under Clinton therefore if Clinton had stayed in office we would now be debt free
* We were on our way to being debt free under Clinton which proves that liberal economic policies are better than all others
* We were on our way to being debt free under Clinton which is proof that Clinton was an awesome President

There was an economic boom when Clinton was President. To what degree was Clinton responsible? I don't know, but [here](http://newsbusters.org/blogs/noel-sheppard/2011/01/23/krugman-shocker-1990s-economic-boom-had-nothing-much-do-clinton) is an article which references the liberal economist Paul Krugman saying:

&gt; Clinton who, in fact, mostly was just riding on a successful economy that was successful mostly for reasons that had nothing much to do with him.

So I'm inclined to believe that the sentiment expressed by Firadin and _Topher_ are true, but they're correcting something I didn't intend to say. I was trying to say:

* We were on our way to being debt free under Clinton (there's a recent example of paying off our debt - using a measure many but not all people think is accurate - rather than going deeper in debt)
not
* We were on our way to being debt free under Clinton (if George W. Bush hadn't screwed up, we would be debt free)

Because it's entirely true to say:

1. We were paying off our debt during good economic conditions
2. We could not do that during bad economic conditions
3. Bad economic conditions will come
4. Therefore in a sense we were never on our way to being debt free

**So the crucial point is that I used - I think justifiably - ""paying down our debt"" interchangeably with ""on our way to being debt free"".** I think we can be on our way to something even if we may never reach the goal. Although I understand why people might think otherwise.

i wasn't going to respond to this. i saw you on reddit during lunch break and i'm a redditing maniac and can't get enough of askreddit.  i thought reddit was another thing we had in common.  between that, being devils fans and the stanley cup, talking about workaholics, you saw you loved arbys and then me getting it, i thought for the first time since grade school i made a real friend.  

i should just stop but i'm home now and i want to get this off my chest.  by the way, aren't you supposed to be in until 4:30 today?  why are you on reddit and not working?

all my life people made fun of me.  the nicknames started in middle school and continued until high school such ugly troll, fat shit, ogre, lots of troll references.  i used to cry myself to sleep at night.  literally as in i literally cried myself to sleep, not literally like in you saying vapid things like that was literally the worst thing ever after the quarterly townhall meeting.  i don't think you're using it right.  high school was even worse when the acne kicked in.  college was basically four years of being alone contemplating suicide.

but you know what?  i don't give a shit anymore.  you may be 6'1' charming in-shape with nice skin, but i have something you will never have.  i am deep down a nice guy.  even after being beaten down more than your shallow ass could ever handle, i still try to smile and see the good in people.  i still genuinely care about people's lives.  i still go out of my way to make the world a brighter place for everyone, not just myself.  you don't care about people.  i noticed when you let the door slam on that lady walking out yesterday.  i also notice how you blatantly poured yourself a giant cup of the free coffee this morning knowing full well you'd finish it and several others including me wouldn't get to have any.  but i looked past those and thought we could still be friends because i try to see the good in people.  maybe i was just excited that i finally thought i made a friend.  who knows.

well fuck yourself.  you win this round.  i'm going to stop talking to you and bothering you.  i won't ask you to go places.  i won't reference workaholics and archer anymore.  i won't buy you lunch to be nice.  i won't even acknowledge you unless it's for a work reason.  you are smarter, more handsome, more liked by the boss, have more friends, are better at everything than me.  but i win in the end.  i have a good heart.  what's the point of having all those things if you have no soul?  you clearly don't.

i'm considering just deleting this but fuck it.  i know i'm ugly.  i know no one likes me.  i have no friends.  kick me when i'm down.  but the next time, think twice before you blatantly dismiss someone for being ugly or different.  maybe deep down it was just a sad lonely guy who just finally wanted to make a friend...................

to people who are sending me messages saying this is fake/making fun of me: first of all, i've been called every name in the book, so it's not worth your time.  the only reason i even posted this was because i guess i really let my guard down since i thought i made a friend.  but if you do think this is a scam, by all means downvote me, send me mean messages!  i've gotten enough love from people to last a lifetime.  this is one of the happiest moments i've ever felt and you can't bring me down.

THE LAST PICTURE WAS OF HER HOLDING THE GUITAR IN ONE HAND AND HER COCK IN THE OTHER.",['milkshakeguts'],0,"My very first job was at a Chick-Fil-A in a mall food court.  Working during the Christmas season was hell on earth and we got a constant stream of some of the most irritable, irate, and unreasonable customers ever.  There was one incident in particular that stands out though, due to how satisfying the turn out was in the end.  

So an incredibly overweight, totally white trash, mother with 5 out of control children comes up and orders a *huge* amount of food.  i wish i could remember the exact order because it was massive.  The bill comes to $40 some dollars.  It's crazily busy with lines of 10 people or more at each of the five registers, all waiting for their food, and this mother, and all 5 of her children are literally yelling ""wheres my food"" and ""hellooo"" the entire time they are waiting, with other customers staring at them and wondering what their problem was.  Finally they get their huge order which was two very large bags full of food, which was what was holding everything up to begin with, and go off to one of the tables in the food court to eat.  

About 10 minutes later the woman comes back, with all 5 of her children by her side, holding her receipt and yelling that she didn't get the food that she ordered.  We ask her what she feels she is missing from the order and she says ""all of it!  all you gave me was 3 bags of waffle fries and a package of chicken nuggets that was already chewed!""  that's right, she said the nuggets were ""already chewed"".  She throws a nugget box on the counter at me with what was definitely chewed up chicken nuggets spit back into the container in it.  First off, we obviously did not give her ""already chewed"" nuggets, and the entire kitchen staff had just madly scrambled to complete everything in her large order, and we handed her two huge bags of food with everything in it.  She starts making a gigantic scene, yelling that we ripped her off and demanding the food that we already gave her.  She starts saying that she is going to call the cops.  There are gigantic lines of really angry people waiting behind her at this point, as it's crazy busy.  At the point when she is threatening to call the cops, some random guy comes walking up and taps her on the shoulder to try and get her attention.  She turns and he says ""miss, you left your bag of food under the table when you left""  and hands her a huge bag of food. The very food she is in the middle of accusing us of not giving her.  At this same time one of her children yells ""those chicken nuggets tasted funny, I hate them!""  To this she looks at the kid and yells ""shut up you little bastard!"" and slaps him on the face. 

So, now that her plot has been hilariously foiled, all of us employees are just staring at her awaiting her response to this.  Her response was to say ""i don't have to take this"" while she grabbed another customers drink that was on the counter and threw it behind the register.  She then tried to storm off, with her 5 children running everywhere and holding her up.  As it turns out, the folks waiting in line just behind her are a police officer who is on lunch with his girlfriend who is a social services worker. The cop, after seeing this arrests the woman, and the social services worker copies down her info and tells her she will be reporting her for hitting her children and exposing them to attempted theft.

"PC platform is dying for a host of reasons, piracy is one of the lesser ones.  

First, Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo have every reason to throw heaps of time, money and effort into ensuring that developers make games exclusive to their own consoles, at least for the first few months and in some cases for years.  The big companies want customers in their closed sandboxes and have done everything they could, for years, to ensure this happens.  Do you blame them for killing PC gaming?

Second, developing for the PC is much harder than developing for a console, even if that console is the PS3.  Every PC is different, different CPU, different video processor, different sound processor, different drivers, different set-up across individual users and often different whole OS.  Troubleshooting and bug fixing is a nightmare on the PC.  Developers know this, so they go with the low hanging fruit by preferring to develop on consoles where one game configuration hits the maximum number of customers with the minimum amount of hassle.  Do you blame developers for the death of PC gaming?

Third, pirating PC games is actually considerably more difficult than pirating console games.  You want to pirate a PC game, you have to find the game and hope the latest patch works for it.  Often applying several different patches, some of which may or may not be virus laden, sometimes from multiple different sources if one doesn't pan out.  You want to pirate a console game, you get a mod chip and in all likelihood it will work for several years across dozens or hundreds of games.  Sure, there will be hassle, but far less than all the dinking around on the PC, in no small part because of the troubleshooting dilemma mentioned above.  The total cost of console+modchip will always be less than a proper gaming PC, so bang-for-buck and bang-for-energy a pirate will always get to play more games for less on a console.  If your logic of piracy as the primary cause applies, it ought to be the consoles dying, not the PC.

Finally, all the big developers and publishers knew this ahead of time.  They knew they would maximize profit through closed-garden computing, so that is where they threw the money, even before it happened.  Microsoft explicitly announced this shit more than 10 years ago, that they were going to move away from PC as the primary gaming platform and almost all the publishers and developers eventually fell in line.  This is why you get to play ports today, not because there isn't money to be made in the PC, but because the best money is throw at consoles first.  So even if all the logic above didn't apply and didn't make sense in the end, once they threw money in that direction, it became a self-fulfilling prophecy.

But hey, go ahead and blame the pirates.  They were pirating PC games over phone lines in 1985 at the same rate they pirated with broadband in 1998 (average game size in 85 was less than 1mb, in 98 was 600mb, today is 8gb) just as much as they do in 2010.  Nonetheless, for some mysterious reason they are the most relevant factor responsible for killing an industry that saw unparalleled growth that entire time.",['[deleted]'],0,"DRM sucks.

"AWESOME STORY, BETTER TL:DR",['stovor'],0,"One summer a friend and I moved down to Myrtle Beach for the summer to bartend and serve food.  It was a really great summer.  I made 18k in three months and came home with 2.

Anyways for those Northerners who don't know, a few bars in Myrtle Beach serve an off-brand version of Everclear from behind the bar.  Our favorite bar that served this was Fat Tuesdays at Broadway at the Beach.  Great bar - the GM at the time was named Finn, and he was a great manager.  He always hooked it up for service industry folks, and knew what it took to reap repeat business.  The place was always packed that summer.  This is important:  they had/have a daiquiri drink there called '190 Octane' that was an orange-flavored drink with a shot of 190-proof liquor.  Fat Tuesdays always puts a shot in your daiquiris with a plastic test tube turned upside down, so it slowly leaches into your drink.  Great stuff.  Well, you could obviously order an additional shot into your drinks, and they'd thrown another test tube upside down into your shit.  This always made the drinks look like someone was giving them the ""bunny ears"" hand gesture, and so we started calling them the ""Bunny ears drink"" to Finn.  Over the course of the summer we could just walk in, make the bunny ears gesture with our fingers and Finn would get us blitzed.

I understand and know how bad the next part of the story is, and don't need a lesson so please don't lecture me.  I mean you can if you want, but I got it.  Trust me.

One night after serving (I don't remember which day of the week it was) we stopped at Fat Tuesdays and got really torn up.  I don't know what compelled us to get so drunk that night, but something did.  The bar closed down and we drove home pretty drunk.  It wasn't a great decision, but we did it anyway.  We were living at Coastal Carolina University at the time, and staying in some decent off-campus housing complex.  Next to our complex was a road that was essentially a service road that dead-ended into a creepy as fuck pond way down in a gully in the woods.  Off that service road was an excavation company (or some other construction-based company) that had a pretty long gated drive up to it with a lot of fields around the drive.  

In our blacked-out haze, my friend and I decided it would be a good idea to try to circumvent the gate and go off-roading on their property (specifically in the fields in front of the company to the side of the drive).  To do this you'd obviously be trespassing, and we were drunker than Satan himself.  We get past the gate in my Jeep Cherokee Sport (2-Door) and we're having a ball driving around in this field.  Because it had rained it was so wet it felt like I was taking a water aerobics class.  Now is a good time to point out that my friend wanted us to do all this with my headlights off, so as not to tip anyone off.  At 3:00 - 4:00 in the morning.  In the middle of fucking nowhere.  

So we're ripping along, headlights off, in 2 wheel drive (because I was too fucked to remember to activate 4WD) when suddenly my Jeep just plunges over an embankment into a fucking river.  Face down ass up. Water starts rushing through the door openings.  I was screaming like a bitch.  My buddy opens his door.  More water starts running in.  I thought for sure the motor was fucked, because it was at least partially submerged.  I turn the car off, and we both get out, and start to assess the situation (while hammered).  We decide to try and lift the Jeep out.  Laughably fail.  We then clim up the embankment and realize that we're fucked.  We're seriously like 10 feet off the main drive that all the employees use to get to their construction company.  At this point, I tell him to just go home, because I don't want him to get busted for this when he doesn't have to, and quite frankly I'm going to need him to bail me out of fucking prison the next day.  So, like a good friend.. he fucking leaves me and goes to sleep (literally).  This was years ago, before  everyone and their mother had a smart phone, and I have the LG Voyager.  I had just started text messaging Google (their number was something like 86866 or something) with things I needed to know.  You could text them for movie times, small businesses in your area, things like that.  You generally just included the zip code and texted ""Movie Times XXXXX.""  I'm sitting there piss drunk and decide to see if my phone still works or was too wet.  It still worked, so I texted ""Towing Company 29526.""  29526 is the zip code for Conway South Carolina where we were staying.  I started getting the texts from Google rolling in, and I told myself to ""Pick the most redneck-sounding company.""  I chose a company called ""DNR Towing.""  The fucker answered on the second ring.  At probably 4:30 in the morning.  At this point I hadn't been expecting anyone to answer, so I was a little taken aback.

Here's our phone conversation:


""*Gurgle Gurgle*  DNR Towing.""

""Yeah man, uhh... I have a problem.  Before I get into details, you should know that this shit won't be legal.""

""Boy, I ain't concerned about the lawww.  Where you at?""

""Yesss.  I'm at:  XXXXXXXX.  Come on down.""


I always carry a few basic tools in my cars for who-knows-why reasons, and low and behold I needed them then.  I hurriedly unscrewed my license plates because I didn't want this guy to write my plate numbers down and report me later, and covered up my VIN with a piece of paper.  I guess I was sobering up.  I then ran back to the apartment complex (about half a mile away) to get all the cash I could get out of an ATM, because I was just going to give him all of it if he got me out of the river.  I also needed to be back there because that was the address I'd given him to meet me at.  I get the cash, and sit down to wait.  He calls me up, and I immediately hear sirens in the background.  My mind racing I hang up on him without saying anything, because I'm thinking the sonofabitch called the cops and fucked me harder than I'd already fucked myself.  Fuck.

He calls me back like 10-12 times, and I'm hiding in the bushes at that point, because I wanted to case out the situation.  All of a sudden I hear the sirens getting closer.  Eventually he passes by me, and he was blaring sirens from his tow truck super early.  I call him back, explain why I didn't answer, yada yada.  We meet up, and he's got a couple buddies with him in a brand new Chevy Silverado behind him.  The thing still had 30 day tags.  They want to use the Silverado to scope out where my Jeep is.  I'm thinking this guy is crazy:  ""why would you want to use a brand new car, get it all fucked up in the woods when we should just use the tow truck...??""  I tell him the end-all agreement is to tow it back to my parking spot, because I'm not sure it'll even run due to water.  He agrees.  We see the spot in the truck, then go back and get the tow truck.  He pulled me out in less than 30 seconds after hooking the car up to the winch.

With water still in the car, I try to turn the Jeep over, and it actually starts.  Seriously.  Go buy a fucking Jeep today.  I then hop it up onto the company's drive, tell him his work is done, and thank him.  I give him the $400.00 and say keep it.  I walk back to the Jeep, get in, and start driving away when I hear screaming at me.  I crank down the window.  The fucking tow truck is stuck in the mud.

I park the Jeep (remember my drunk ass had somehow had the foresight to remove my plates), and walk over to them.  His tires are about 18"" deep in mud, just spinning and vibrating like a fucking hummingbird.  I tell him that I was sorry, but I had to leave them to get my car off the property and that I'd come back to help them.  They were fucking pissed.  I left anyway, parked my car, and being the good guy that I am, ran my ass back there to help them.  To this day, I'll never forget the look in their faces when they saw me.  They were stunned I'd come back.  Nothing interesting here on out:  we ended up using their tow truck's extendable ""stinger"" thing to get him pushed out on its own.  He angled the stinger down, and extended it.  That would lift the truck up and push it forward on its front wheels.  We got it on dry-er land, said our goodbyes, and they drove away.  I started walking down the road, and I swear to whatever god is up there that right as I rounded the corner, the first employee headlights were visible coming down the service road to their drive.  The movie Michael Clayton was years away, but I swear that fucker has nothing on me.

I don't really remember the specifics of the game. I played pretty aggressively, and I don't think he took me seriously to begin with, which was to his credit, because who tries to crush an eleven year old in a chess game?

Anyway, there was a moment that definitely stuck with me, the second time I checked him. He looked down at the board, back up at me, and smiled. Then he said, ""I was not expecting brilliance.""

The size of Darryl's office also presents a problem, because now the column is less than three feet from the wall - an accessibility issue. In other words, either the entire scale of the floorplan needs to be rethought, or Darryl's office is significantly smaller than shown.

Lastly, I would say that Ryan's closet/office should be moved more to the right, as I don't think that door was that far away from the Women's bathroom. In fact all three doors should be fairly close to each other.

The Cuban revolution massively improved life for blacks on the island. This one is just propaganda/slander/lies. 

He did apparently preside over a book burning once. (EDIT: Might have been to quick here. Not seen any solid evidence yet, not convinced either way.)

He was anti-gay to some degree, considering a decadent thing born i capitalism. The regime was cruel to homosexuals. However, there is nothing to suggest Che ever killed anyone for being gay, it wasn't considered that bad a thing. There were harassment, imprisonment and deportation. Fidel actually eventually apologized for this, admitting they were wrong on homosexuality (in the 90s I think). 

He definitely did not ban music.

He was indeed willing to kill in battle and to execute adversaries, and did so many times. He was neither a democrat nor a lover of free speech. He was a big fan of Stalin early on, but after visiting Soviet he didn't like what he saw and changed his mind on that.

Look, I can play this game, too. How about we change **express your free speech** to **worship an imaginary God**, and I can turn the question right around back to you. However, for atheists, it goes a little deeper than that.

You see, there are many of us (not just on Reddit, but across the planet) who don't just see religion as a harmless little indulgence, a sad sort of psychosis which infects its victims with a benign delirium. The fact is, we see it precisely the same way we see psychics, homeopathy, and other related woo-- latent on the small scale, but extremely dangerous on the large scale. 

In all cases, we see them as an active enemy of the most positive aspects of humanity: growth, knowledge, inquiry, and freedom of expression and thought. The difference between organized religion and homeopathy, though, is that in one case you're dealing with ignorance and self delusion which makes people take imaginary medicine, while in the other case you're dealing with ignorance and self delusion which, on a daily basis, is used as justification for violence and crimes against humanity. 

To put it shortly: when someone ""overdoses"" on a ""homeopathic remedy,"" they waste a few bucks and ingest a handful of water pills. When someone overdoses on Islam, homosexuals are stoned to death for the crime of being born with the wrong urges, women are beaten and abused for the crime of seeking an education, and innocent people are murdered for the crimes of thought, writing, and art.

In all cases, we also recognize the most damning implication of your particular form of woo-worship-- the potential for damage to children. We simply can't refuse to fight these battles (be they religious or otherwise) now out of convenience or propriety, because every day that passes means the continued indoctrination and stultification of the minds of children too young to know that they're being systematically blinded as they walk down a path blazed, paved, and kept in high maintenance by the blind.

When you deal with Reddit (and with the thinkers and do-ers of the modern world as a whole), you're dealing with a community which places a high value on the scientific method and on establishing truth based on observable evidence and demonstrable patterns and tendency. As such, most of us don't buy the ""I'm a Muslim/Christian/Jew, but only the good parts"" line. If that's way you want to live your life, that's fine... we all have our hypocrisies. However, when you choose to support a given worldview in speech, thought, writing, and practice, you aren't just propping up the form of the system which may exist in your mind and heart; you're propping up the system as it exists throughout the world, aiding in its dissemination and growth, even if unintentionally. Given the tenets of your faith (not the tenets you choose to live by, but the established tenets of the faith as they are written), this is, frankly, unacceptable.

For example, in Islam, the penalty for apostasy is death. Whether you choose to honor this particular tenet of Islam is irrelevant, as your ignoring it doesn't mean you're a progressive Muslim-- it means that you identify as a Muslim, but do not adhere to the faith in its entirety and choose to ignore the passages which make you uncomfortable. This is a far cry from adhering to the laws of Allah as established by The Prophet. This alone is enough to make many of us (myself included) declare ourselves to be an enemy of Islam, as at no time, in no place, is it acceptable to decree that death is a just and required punishment for those who've engaged in nothing more than freedom of thought. This is to say nothing, of course, of actually practicing such barbarity. 

We could go down the list of crimes against humanity outlined in Sharia, but I don't feel it necessary to belabor the point.

Islam is not alone in this-- in my mind (as well as the minds of many other secularists), anyone who would, at this point, continue to support the Catholic church, in essence or practice, has much for which to answer. This can (and should) be said of Jews concerning Israeli actions in Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, as well as ""God fearing"" protestants concerning the systematic oppression of homosexuals in what they like to call the ""bastion of freedom,"" the United States. I say this now only to ensure you that the atheist distaste and often outright vocal hostility for something that's ""doing nothing, absolutely nothing for you"" is not limited to your faith; it's open to absolutely every faith and worldview which brings unnecessary harm to others by legitimizing hatred and nonsense. It's just that your particular faith tends to make more a spectacle of their own particular psychosis than others, meaning retaliations tend to be more of a spectacle in themselves.

Last, I'd like to address a particularly childish slight you embedded in your comment:

&gt; many redditors need to get a life. 

Most Redditors HAVE a life, and a large portion of us see no evidence to indicate that we'll ever have a life OUTSIDE of this life. It's for this reason that we wage our battles the way we do-- sure, we could just let what's happening concerning Islam and free speech slide, say ""it isn't our problem"" or ""I don't need to offend anyone even if I am pissed."" That's the easy way out. Instead, some of us take it upon ourselves to fight for the ethics of liberty and freedom in whatever way we can... if that method happens to be bringing the fight to the submissions and comments on Reddit, then so be it! If not today, when? If we ever hope to see this world change for the better, it MUST be today. At least we're doing SOMETHING, and that something is not, as many people of faith like to claim, pointless or preaching to the choir. Sharing anger or distaste is a process of galvanization. It's a process which encourages OTHERS to speak out, loud and proud, against this sickness, and to do so with the confidence that they aren't alone. It's a process which encourages thought and discussion, and provides individuals with a way to refine their thoughts and thought processes.

In summation, your choice (and the choice of the OP) to paint the secularists involved in this battle of ideas as nothing more than online trolls without a life, looking for karma by being offensive, is nothing more than absolute bullshit used to cover the fact that the ethical ground and moral justifications on which you stand are about as steady as a two-legged stool.",1503,1503,ayesee,0,-9

What is porn? Justice Potter Stewart once said in referal to the film 'The Lovers' in the Jacobellis v.

But I know it when I see it, &amp; the motion picture involved in this case is not that.”

This is a very important question to ask.  What is pornography?  Potter, as I quoted says ""I know it when I see it"" &amp; I am with him on this.  Many words, which are abstract concepts, in the human language de-evovle into meanlingless often when getting into the most complex of debates.  When abortion is brought up we spend hours arguing over the definition of ""life"" &amp; trying to assign an arbitrary moment to when it begins in order to enhance our stance on either side of the debate under the law. Does it happen at conception or at birth? Or is it during a particular stage of the pregnancy? 

When debating music with family &amp; friends, eventually someone might make a claim that this musician 'is not art' &amp; that artist is - leaving us to ask exactly, ""what is art?"".  

Life, art, pornography &amp; many other terms enter into debates of mind boggling subjectivity. Like beauty - often all these things are in the eyes of the beholder. Potter hit the nail on the head, &amp; it's also the corner stone of all of these debate - ""i know it when i see it"".   This leaves it all open to subjective interpretation. 

Wikipedia defines pornography as so; ""Pornography or porn is the portrayal of explicit sexual subject matter for the purposes of sexual excitement &amp; erotic satisfaction."" 

Potter implied that for something to be considered porn one must look at the intent &amp; the context of the material - hence how he knows it when he sees it.  So one must ask - does pornography require nudity?   Does nudity imply that something is pornographic? 

Salvador Dali has painted nude female breasts into a number of his surrealist paintings, Michaelangelo has painted &amp; sculpted a number of nude human beings in his works.  Yet most human beings, Josh Ashcroft excluded, generally consider these  depictions of the human  body as art &amp; not pornography.  My mother, like many mothers, has pictures of me as a baby, nude, in a tub getting a bath. This too is not considered pornogrpahy by most.  Diaper commercials &amp; Hallmark cards once used to show baby's bare bottoms, this too is not porn. These works are not intented to arouse sexual excitement nor for a person to derivive erotic satisfaction from them.

Is nudity required for something to be pornographic? In Reddit's Jailbait &amp; MaleJailBait there were many pictures of scantly clad preteeen &amp; teen children in erotic poses, but none of these pictures are nude &amp; they had strict rules requiring that no nudity be posted. The  ban on nudity seems to be strictly a legal precaution rather than a line in the sand which one all of a sudden loses their moral compass once stepped over. 

Constantly you see the circle jerk debate about the differences between Ephebophilia &amp; Pedophilia.  What this debate largely ignores is that ""statuatory rape"" &amp; ""child porn"" laws are generally built around consent.   And these children, are not of age to consent for sex, to make porn or anything of the sort.

Links to offending images are titled things such as ""Gorgeous"", ""I wasn't looking at her eyes anyway"", ""love those redheads"", ""yummy"", &amp; ""lots of legs"".  

The name of the sub-community itself implies intent &amp; context.  ""Jail"" &amp; ""bait"".  This implies the girls are underage.  All of these  girls are either underage, or meant to look underage.  Not only are they underage, but apparently they are so sexually alluring that they are ""bait""; coercing adult men into commiting acts of statutory rape or child molestation that would most certainly land them in jail.  Thus; 'jail bait'.

This is a common theme we see in our society.  In [2011 a New York Times article covered a story](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/09/us/09assault.html?_r=2) on a 11 year old girl who was gang raped by 18 boys, a video was taken of the incident &amp; shown around school.  The article in question interviewed community members who asked questions &amp; made statements such as;  

* ""she dressed older than her age, wearing makeup &amp; fashions more appropriate to a woman in her 20s.""

* “Where was her mother? What was her mother thinking?” said Ms. Harrison, one of a handful of neighbors who would speak on the record. 

* “It’s just destroyed our community,” said Sheila Harrison, 48, a hospital worker who says she knows several of the defendants. “These boys have to live with this the rest of their lives.”
	
See the line of thought?  The girl was dressing sexy, so those poor boys just couldn't help themselves!  The community asks where the girl's mother is rather than where the parents were of the 18 boys who raped her.  Sheila Harrison is deeply concerned with what those 18 rapists will have to live with for the rest of their lives, never once concerning herself with the pain &amp; anguish that 11 year old girl will have to suffer.

This mimmicks the cries &amp; whines of the former jailbait communities - those girls took those pictures themselves! look at how sexy they dressed themselves! ""They are asking for this kind of attention"".  These are generally comments made by grown-ass-men.

Constantly throughout history &amp; modern times do we see that men ""just can't help themselves"".  During the Victorian period, this was a common thought &amp; the motivation for women to cover up.  Certain sects of Islam requires their women to be in Burkas much for the same reason.  Rape case after rape case in American court rooms attack a woman's style of dress or her past promiscuity to throw doubt on her claims to rape because we all know a promiscuous woman dressed sexy is ""just asking for it.""  I don't know why we make excuses as a society when it comes to violating a woman's consent but we do. We do it in virtually every culture across the globe.

We don't much respect women in this world, nor their safety.  Not even when they are society's children.  The excuse we give is men cannot control themselves.  When real rape &amp; molestation actually happens, it is typical to hear blame on the attractiveness of the woman &amp; how this renders a man to his more primal, uncontrollable instincts.  Here, on Reddit, we had a community that plays up on this urge to commit a crime &amp; to land in jail.  But this isn't just a crime towards women, it's to children - male &amp; female alike.  Even transgendered children were exploited in this way.

Reddit's Jailbait was a community that thumbs its nose at the law.  It knows what it is suggesting &amp; encouraging is illegal &amp; participants posts pictures as far as the law will allow.  It had rules posted up to ensure quality, requiring that no pictures of the girls should have tattoos as this casts doubt on the girls'  underage status.  They know they are towing the absolute legal limit of the law, &amp; skirt by on technicality alone.  I am of the opinion that even if they are not violating the letter of the law, **they sure as hell are violating the spirit &amp; intent of the law.**

For a community that does not show nudity &amp; they do not consider what they are trading as pornography, ironically, when entering these communuties you are prompted with warning message that states:

""You must be at least eighteen to view this reddit""  

Then you are asked ""Are you over eighteen &amp; willing to see adult content?"" &amp; are given Yes &amp; No choices.  

For a non-pornographic community showing pictures of children they're sure to let you know this the content is still very 'adult' in nature.

I submit the idea that what they are posting, clothed or not, is child pornography. ""I know it when I see it"" is what the Justice said &amp; I fully concur.  There may be no nudity, but this is the non-consentual trade of erotic pictures of underage children for the purposes of sexual excitement &amp; erotic satisfaction of adult men.

Furthermore, this community mocked the reality that many people do make the claim that they cannot control themselves in the presense of 'bait' in the very thing they decided to name their community.

As Fred Phelps tests the limits of the 1st Amendment with his ""God Hates Fags"" military funeral protests, communities like JailBait test our limits of not only the 1st Amendment, but how far we will allow the children of this nation &amp; all nations to be  exploited for the purpose of sexual gratification of adults. 

Where do the pictures come from?

I consider myself &amp; my generation lucky.  I grew up with the internet - but without modern state of it where privacy is a sham and before the masses caught on.  Human beings are sexual creatures.  Discovering &amp; exploring our sexualities can be a fumbling process.  We live in a society wrought with taboos, religious shame, a hyper-sexual media, advertisements that push sex to sell everything from cars to tacos. Kid's products, tv shows &amp; music stars constantly push the envelope on how much child sexuality is ok to show &amp; exploit for a buck.  We're influenced by our peers, by our parents, by our environment at large.  It's a complicated issue &amp; the development of it in our emotionally turblent adolescence is probably the most confusing period for all of us.  We are naive &amp; some of us do stupid things when looking to make connection with the opposite (or same) gender for the first couple of times.   Nowadays when you do something irresponsible during the follies of youth &amp; sexual exploration, it has the potential to have a permanent residence on the internet &amp; to be exploited by grown adults in communities like Jailbait &amp; MaleJailBait, or communities that are far worse.

What happens if they go for something that could be a gun?

&gt;He followed Martin, but lost track of him. He was returning to his SUV when Martin approached him from the left rear and confronted him. Martin asked him, ""Do you have a problem?""[110] He replied ""No"", and Martin then said, ""Well, you do now"" or something similar,[110] while Zimmerman reached for his cell phone.

That is Zimmerman's version of events. A strange guy is following you. You ask him if he has a problem. He says no, then reaches for something. He may have had a gun.

In fact, he did.

Hypothetical:

Zimmerman reaches for his phone exposing his gun. Martin sees the gun and assumes Zimmerman is trying to pull it out and grabs for it at the same time. They fall to the ground fighting over the gun. Eventually, the larger Zimmerman overpowers Martin, turning the gun on him and pulling the trigger.

That is why stand your ground laws are bad. Who is actually at fault if the above is what happened? Zimmerman brought a gun into the confrontation, but he was legally carrying it. Martin had every right to defend himself if he felt that his life was in danger, which it clearly was. Then again, once Martin tries to grab his gun, Zimmerman has every right to defend himself too.

I stopped reading when I heard the garage door open, and started walking downstairs towards the hallway leading to the garage. When I reached halfway down my staircase, I see my Dad walking down the hallway with only the nightlights shining in the hallway illuminating the hall. It was strange of him to not turn on the lights because he usually did when he got home from work. I casually said, ""hi Dad"", and climbed back up the stairs to my Mom's room. I  told my Mom that Dad was home, but she responded in a manner of disbelief and confusion. She said that it was too early for him to be back at work and that she didn't hear the garage door open. I argued and said that I just saw him and greeted him, but she thought I was nuts. So, I went back downstairs to prove that I was right, but the whole downstairs area was vacant. I checked his office, the kitchen, the hallway, bathrooms, and he wasn't present. It took me a good 5 minutes to realize that I had just seen something out of the ordinary, and when I did realize it, I sprinted to my Mom's room in fear. I explained the whole situation to my Mom, but she didn't believe me and told me to calm down. An hour later, I heard the garage door open again, but this time, the lights actually turned on and my Dad actually came home from work. So wtf did I see?

The reality however is, the wealthy don't pay taxes and use the extra money to open that factory in China where they can pay their workers significantly less and give them no benefits.

Bottomline: They are not going to use the money to make America better.  They're going to use it to make themselves richer.",['z3m'],0,"What is the logic to this, though? I mean, there has to be a good reason we don't like taxing the rich. From my stand-point, as an economics laymen, I just think ""This is fucked up!"".

But, they're also deeply conservative, too, so I feel like I'm just being convinced out of my own ignorance.

So, without wild accusations (Eg. ""The rich taking over the country!"" true but that can't be the only reason, or even the purpose explicitly stated on the floor), what is the economical reasoning for this? Is it really just the case that we don't want to tax the wealthy BECAUSE we want them to spend it to increase the wealth? If so, couldn't we just tax them and take their money anyway. Such case seems to balance out regardless. (Or, are they afraid the rich would then store the money on an off-shore account, thereby distributing the money to other nations?).

I am a woman, working in the STEM field, getting paid on exactly the same level as my male (and other female!) coworkers and working the same amount they do, and my male SO (ALSO in the STEM field) carries an equal share of ALL outside-of-work duties and responsibilities. If ANY relationship is as one-sided as yours apparently are, since you seem to think that *everyone* expects women to do all housework etc, then that person should re-evaluate because that's complete bullshit.

Nowhere in the post did it say she makes less than he does. It DOES state that she has access to daycare, and therefore she DOESN'T have to constantly care for her child, yet she makes the decision to neglect her work to needlessly obsess about her offspring instead of actually trusting that they will care for him so she can focus on work - that's not something that more help/better support systems would remedy, that's on her. 

The biggest flaw in your argument is that you seem to think she deserved the promotion despite not being able to handle the duties said promotion would likely require. **Egalitarianism by definition  is treating everyone the exact same** - which her company clearly did by evaluating two workers and choosing the one best suited for the job. She may not be able to work at that level - there's nothing wrong with that, there are plenty of men and women in the same situation. If she CAN work at that level, then she is choosing not to - which is (again) on her.

*edit - holy crap, I had no idea this little post would get so much attention! To address the most common response: blind people can enjoy a movie by listening to it, and often times will watch with another person who is willing to narrate the action as they watch together. It may be hard for you to grasp how that would be enjoyable, but when it's the only way you've ever known, you've nothing to compare it to!

I told him many of your answers and this is what he said:

""I get that hearing a wolf, or any dangerous wild animal, in an actual setting where you may be in danger would be terrifying. I still think it's corny to hear it in the background of a horror movie, out of context from anything else going on, like some silly trope. Now that I think about it, it is only in cheesy movies that it happens. By the way, in a more direct response to the original question, people should know that most blind people probably have a mental concept of which animals look strange or weird based on the fact that people will refer to them that way. I know that a giraffe has a weird long neck that stretches to the sky without having seen one, and that a cat is not weird looking but an aardvark is. The thing is, don't people have these opinions just because everyone decided it? I bet a cat looks pretty weird to an aardvark.""

HOLY FUCK THEY HAD DOWEL GUNS?,['gifforc'],0,"Carjacked by a guy who had just robbed an auto store. This was Decemeber of 2002. 

I had just gotten done dropping my then wife off at the airport. She was flying back to California for Christmas. I stopped by Wendy's on the way because nothing says woo woo a week of peace and quiet like two Jr. Bacon Cheeseburgers. 

Unknown to me, at about this time, three people were robbing at auto parts store in Georgetown, Texas. Georgetown is a small town north of Austin and Round Rock but still very much a suburb of Austin. These three pistol whipped the clerks, stole money, and stole a vehicle to get away. They proceed to go down south on I-35 from Georgetown to Austin. One of the clerks flagged down a passing cop and pointed out the stolen vehicle, so by this time the three idiots had two cop cars in pursuit of them.

Meanwhile, I was driving northbound on the frontage road of I-35. The frontage road was moving much faster that the freeway was and I kind of dig riding the frontage roads. This was also the last Friday before Christmas that year, so I suspect we had a lot more traffic than normal. 

The suspects hit a traffic jam on southbound I-35 and traffic literally came to a halt. Two of the suspects jumped out of the car and over the center divider. Multiple officers did the same thing giving pursuit. One cop shattered his ankle while landing because it was about an 8 foot drop.  The third guy gave up in the car. 

I was about to meet a guy with a gun.

About this time I saw a Sheriff's Deputy running southbound on the northbound shoulder.  Traffic in front of me came to a standstill and so did I. At this point I saw the cop stop about 60 feet away and draw his gun. 
I turn my head to see someone standing at my door. He reaches into his waistband, pulls out a gun, puts it to my head and says,"" Get out of the fucking car"". Meanwhile the deputy is yelling drop the gun, get down, etc, etc. As I was getting out of the car and the carjacker was getting in, he put the gun to the back of my head. Sheriff then fired the first shot. It hit the carjacker in the shoulder and knocked the gun away from my head. They then started exchanging shots with each other. I hit the deck and then realizing how close I was to the action, got up, ran like hell for the grass and dropped there. 

The third guy kept running all the way to Mexico. He has never been caught.
Suspect got hit 3 times. He was hit in the shoulder, head and through the hand. The shot to the head entered the front of his head and went AROUND the outside of the skull and exited the back of his head. Didn’t pierce his skull at all.  And for a little bit of karma justice, he additionally got shrapnel from my dashboard in his stomach as it exploded from the gun fire. 

I survived with glass in my head and a new lease on life.

TL:DR Got carjacked, THERE WAS A FIREFIGHT, ran like Carl Lewis, lived!

To answer the most common questions.

I only had liability so had to pay for the damage myself. In theory I may have been able to get some compensation from the city or victim's assistance but quite honestly was just happy to be alive.

Some comments on did the officer put my life in danger by firing a shot. I don't know what was happening behind me. I didn't see it. I have come to know the officer very well since the incident and do not in anyway believe that he would have fired had he not thought that his life or mine was in imminent danger. I believe to this day that if he hadn't fired I would be dead now. And truthfully, doesn't matter, I lived! 

The TL:DR is meant to be read in the voice of William Defoe. 

Grabbing scotch!

EDIT: Picture of car getting all CSI'd on afterwards.

Edit: I had bought my husband the watch for our anniversary and given it to him on our trip. He put the watch back in the box and packed it in his bag. When we landed at home the bag was completely unzipped when we took it from the conveyor belt. We checked the contents right then and there but nothing seemed missing. While unpacking at home my husband decided to take the watch out and found someone had removed the watch and reassembled the packaging. When I contacted the airline they said they didn't cover stolen jewelry, clothes, electronics, or prescription medicine. And even if they *did* cover it, you had to file a claim before leaving the airport. 

Edit 2: Since then I now use a TSA lock on my luggage. It's a combination lock that has a space for a TSA key to unlock it.

FUCK I HATE BAYLOR NOW. JUST REMEMBER THAT THEIR BEST EVER SEASON CULMINATED IN A LOSS TO UCF ,['wafflesnsyrup'],0,"I posted this a little while back in a thread about unusual rivalries or teams you don't like, and it sums up my feelings pretty well.

&gt;To be perfectly honest, I really hadn't known much about Baylor until a couple of years ago. We don't normally play them, they're not a traditional power house, and they don't have quite the presence in CFB that other teams do. So when we played them in the 2012 Holiday Bowl, I really wasn't sure what to expect. I'd heard that they were a good team that season and was expecting a fun game. And then the game started and they flat out demolished us.

&gt;So that was bad enough. Going to a bowl only to be humiliated like that is never fun. But then I came here to /r/CFB and saw nothing but disrespectful trash talk from Baylor fans. It went on for a few weeks and they just ripped UCLA every chance they got (as did other fans, seeing as how badly we got beat). It was quite unpleasant, but I chalked it up to a small group of fans who were a little overly excited.

&gt;But then [Baylor went and did this.](http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/eye-on-college-football/22773725/photo-baylor-holiday-bowl-ring-shorts-ucla-final-touchdown) In case you didn't see the game or don't remember, the [final score was 49-26.](http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=323620026) In the last seconds of the game UCLA threw a pass that resulted in a TD. However, it was pretty clear that the pass came up a yard or so short of the goal line, but there was no time left to review it and it really had no impact on the game. The call stood, and the game was over. Bad calls happen all the time, this one had no bearing on the game, whatever. Apparently Baylor didn't like this, so they decided to change the score when ordering their commemorative bowl rings.

&gt;As far as I'm concerned, that was a horrible display of sportsmanship. They weren't satisfied with winning the game, no, they had to go and make sure the score was even more lopsided. Instead of celebrating the win and enjoying a quality victory, the coaches spent the last few seconds arguing about a touchdown that had absolutely no bearing on the game, about a UCLA freshman who had just scored for the first time in a college game (a bowl game, no less). And the worst part is that this was done by the people in charge, the coaches and/or the administration were okay with this. This wasn't some young kid on the team or just some angry fans. The Baylor officials made a deliberate decision regarding the rings and the score.

&gt;I haven't forgotten that, and I probably won't for some time. Maybe I'm just a sore loser, but that was just kicking us when we were down. Intentionally adding insult to injury is not something I agree with. That game and the following week or so left a very sour taste in my mouth. You don't get to rewrite history because you don't agree with a meaningless call. I hope Baylor loses every game they ever play. I hope the program falls apart and every team in Texas demolishes them from here on out. I hope their fans learn some humility. I hope Art Briles accidentally drops that ring in the toilet and shits all over it. Fuck Texas? No, Fuck Baylor.",141,141,justsomeguy75,0,95

So yeah, qwertyuiop54213, that's the story of my 18th birthday, and a little bit about what happened afterwards. This girl and I had a few brief reconnections over the years, but had grown to be very different people than we were when we met. I spoke to a mutual friend of hers recently and hear she is doing well. She has a job and is going to school and all that jazz. I've fallen in love once since then, and that in itself was a wonderful, beautiful relationship that lasted two years and also had a lot to do with my growth as a person. It's weird to think that all of this happened only four years ago. It's almost like having the memories of a different person. Then again, the person I was 6 months ago (in a relationship, different city, different life) is so drastically removed from the person I am today that it is almost hard to compare.

I would peg the XBOX1\PS2\GCN as the last true console ""Traditional"" generation, with the last one and this one as grey areas to the new era. 


Tech wise I would suspect we will see probably another generation though it may not be a true bigger/badder HW leap and might incorporate more features of the mobile world. 

I could definitely see a drop in AAA titles and heavy hardware in the next 5 years since the casual crack-like games filled with in app purchases that the mobile market is currently saturated with are vastly more profitable. a game like Titanfall can cost in the tens to $100Mil+ and even if it sells 3 million copies at $60 each that's only $180 million (gross). Hay Day makes $2.4 million a *day* with a longer revenue period (years instead of a short sale spike then drop off) 

I predict that future consoles will be geared towards slightly larger scale mobile type gaming  and integrating with mobile devices since that's where the money is.

**Edit:**  So getting a few ""So you are mad because you wanted to steal?""  There's a bit more to this than just getting the latest song for free.  So kids, come sit at Uncle Maiker's feet and let me tell you story.

**O**nce upon a time, way back in the mid/late 90's, there was no way to get music digitally.  We had our Pentium PCs rocking Winamp, we had our 16mb digital music players.  Fraunhauser had just released a cool program that could compress a 40mb (HD's were 400mb - 1gb) wav file into a 4mb file - he called the final file MP3s

Granted you could hit up the MP3 rooms in AOL, but the selection and speed sucked (28.8-34.4 kbs connection).  You could rip a CD, but you may not have the HD space and it took 4-8 hours.  We had the tools and the demand to experience music to the fullest... but no music.

Then the great dragon Napster came along.  All the world's music at your fingertips.  It wasn't about getting it for free, it was about just getting it.  THIS is what the fans wanted.

The record companies and artists freaked the fuck out.  ""It's going to be the end of the industry!"" they said.  ""Almost as bad as cassette tapes!""

Then a Mr. Lars Ulrich stepped forward and said to the fans ""Fuck you guys, we do what we want.  If you don't like it, blow me.  You should be grateful to have us in your lives you thieving peons."" (Paraphrase of an actual quote that I can't find). 

And we begged ""Please o Mighty Lars, give us a way to get your music digitally!!!!""  And Lars, with an arrogant smirk ""Fuck off, get your punk asses to a record store like we want you to.""

And the mighty Lars, with the backing of the industry, slew the evil dragon named Napster.

But the mighty dragon had laid eggs.  And those eggs hatched to be Kazza, Grokster, Bittorrent, Limewire, and many others.  Finally the industry knew that with each dragon they would slay, more would take it's place.  

So after many lawsuits, much backlash, some pretty pissed off fans, and people getting used to downloading music for free; they finally saddled the dragon known as iTunes.  Imagine where we would be had Lars and his merry RIAA members saddled Napster?

So kids, that's why to this day myself and and many others say:

It's both parties, on Pacquiao's side it's Bob Arum who refuses to make the fight happen, he likes his fighters to fight within Top Rank, that way most the revenue is paid to him.

On Mayweather's side, he consistently finds reasons for the fight not happening, whether it's demands for testing, a ridiculous split purse of 60/40 for himself and no payment to Pacquiao camp for PPV earnings. Of course Pacquiao isn't going to accept that.

No one side is afraid of the other, especially after Pacquiao's last fight, I do believe Mayweather thinks it'll be easier now then when negotiations began a few years ago. And Pacquaio never refused testing, and Mayweather needs to stop negotiating through Twitter.

The surrender is a convention and works very well.  It makes sense for both teams involved not to continue wasting time on a sunk game.  I agree and think that it would add a lot of value to Halo in the long term.

**Edit for clarification:**
The surrender feature comes down to two different options:

1. Individuals on the team could choose when they're no longer willing to play in a game, and thus quit individually. This is exhibited in SC2 and Halo.

2. The team must decide as a whole, or majority, to quit the game. In this case, the least common factor must be the decision to quit. This is exhibited in League of Legends.

Deciding which is better is still up for debate. However, I think that the League of Legends convention should be applied to Halo.",318,318,HaloLegend98,0,74

If we all did that, would it not make more of an impact?

Edit*

Here is the letter I wrote to my Senators, in which a lot of my information coming from torrentfreak, and their research.

Dear Senator name,

It has recently come to the attention of myself and the internet masses the introduction of the PROTECT IP bill. I am writing you in hopes of winning your support in the opposition of this bill. 
	
Recently while browsing the social website reddit.com, I came across a discussion about the PROTECT IP bill. It seems the hacker group ‘anonymous^1’ has decided to target the Chamber of Commerce website for a DDoS^2 attack, effectively rendering the website useless. This is the same group and same tactic used in the past against organizations such as H.B. Gary Federal, Bank of America, Sony Entertainment, and the Westboro Baptist Church.

I disagree with this methodology whole heartedly.

The problem is, however, that the general masses do not believe a well written letter is a viable means of action to protest that which they disagree with. There is a disproportionate amount of people that believe the only way to get the PROTECT IP bill the media attention it deserves is to take down websites, and as such, plan to do just that^3.

I am writing this letter in hopes to prove the aforementioned ideals are false.

When the COICA bill was on the table, Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, became a hero of sorts to the general public for stepping in and placing that pending legislation on hold.  He stated 

""It seems to me that online copyright infringement is a legitimate problem, but it seems to me that COICA as written is the wrong medicine. Deploying this statute to combat online copyright infringement seems almost like using a bunker-busting cluster bomb when what you really need is a precision-guided missile. The collateral damage of this statute could be American innovation, American jobs, and a secure Internet.”^4

The PROTECT IP bill is seen as a re-drafted, yet equally disheartening successor to the COICA bill.

The summary of the bill begins with a recital of the now-standard industry claims about the financial harm caused by copyright infringement. Claims that interestingly enough were put in doubt by the U.S. Government last year, but are still used to push anti-piracy legislation through globally.^5

It is further explained that the PROTECT IP Act is needed as an extension of the already controversial domain seizures taking place under “Operation In-Our-Sites”; an operation legal experts^6 and Senators^7 alike have both critiqued heavily, questioning the Constitutionality of the practices used in the operations.

Furthermore, the PROCTECT IP bill states 

“If the court issues an order against the registrant, owner, or domain name, resulting from the DOJ-initiated suit, the Attorney General is authorized to serve that order on specified U.S. based third-parties, including Internet service providers, payment processors, online advertising network providers, and search engines. These third parties would then be required to take appropriate action to either prevent access to the Internet site, or cease doing business with the Internet site.” 

Although the above is already quite far-reaching, the bill also allows for private copyright holders to use some of the same tools as the Government. Without due process, copyright holders can obtain a court order to prevent payment providers and ad-networks from doing business with sites that allegedly facilitate copyright infringement.

While counterfeiting and piracy remain concerns to the public and private sectors alike, this bill is not in the best interest of the public and serves only to help the private companies.  It is with this thought that I reach out to you to find out where you stand on this critical issue.

I thank you for your time in reading this. As referenced above, I do not believe in the validity of attacking websites as a viable means of protest. I’d rather form a well versed letter. In doing this, I am hoping you allocate a reasonable amount of time in your response to my inquiry on where you stand on this controversial legislative bill.

Again, thank you for your time, and I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,
brainface

Well, as the story goes, approx. a week and a half later, the bite mark got bigger, and hurt more and more. One day, while laying in bed, he says it hurts all of a sudden. Looks down, and sees that the bump is now pussing. No wait, let's take a closer look, it seems as if the puss is crawling up his legs. It's not puss. It's thousands of baby spiders bursting out of a hole in his leg.

Premise of it being a woman asks questions to three men she can't see and, based on their answers, pick one to go on a (blind) date with.

Looks like she picked Mr Bean, and the bachelorette and her chosen date would commonly hug and/or kiss each other on the cheek in greeting when they'd first see each other, before waving to the audience and walking off.

So, in this scenario, it's not that presumptive of the woman to assume he wanted a hug as the canon of the show kind of expects it at that moment.

"**The Disappearance of the Dragons**

Dragons became more elusive after losing their grip on power.[12] Their numbers dwindled over the years due to many causes: their population in Akavir was wiped out by the Tsaesci, who also brought their onslaught to Tamriel, and the dragons in Vvardenfell were overrun by invading cliff racers.[4] The Akaviri Dragonguard and its successor, the Blades, along with other heroes, hunted dragons and their followers throughout the eras until dragons were nearly extinct.[6][11][13][14][15] Tiber Septim offered those who remained protection in return for their fealty.[2] Despite his pledge, almost all known wild dragons were killed or driven off, disappearing from sight in Tamriel.[11][2]

Some sources claim that all dragons disappeared at once, being devoured by a dragon king or absorbed by Tiber Septim when he ascended to godhood.[2] Many held the belief that the dragons were extinct.[citation needed] This was not true, as live dragons continued to exist throughout the Third and early Fourth Era. The Akatosh Chantry hold dragons as their holy symbol, and keep tamed dragons in their ""sacred grove"".[16][17] Many ancient legends tell of dragons making deals with other races to protect themselves.[6][11][18][19][20] According to Brarilu Theran, at least one dragon is known to have laired in the smoking ruins of Vvardenfell after the Red Year, long after the cliff racers were driven off by Saint Jiub.[21]

We make some ridiculous claim, but make it seem reasonable. We flood the internet with it (ie, Facebook, YouTube, Tumblr, ~~9gag~~) and spread it as much as possible, and encourage others to do so as well. We create, in addition to the viral video, a Wikipedia page, (with a standard information template for us all to post to it) or multiple Wikipedia pages, and a website. We will also need a dedicated YouTube channel for it, and multiple Facebook groups.  We begin to sell merchandise, in a similar manner to KONY 2012, and arrange an massive real world event, again, similar to KONY 2012, only on the date of said event, to proclaim it as some massive scheme, or scheme type thing to show how susceptible the world is to this type of thing, and donate any profit to some real cause. Merchandise that could be sold: 
Clothing, such as shirts, sweaters, ect,
Bracelets,
Ballons, (could be the event, balloons filled with skittles, and have a URL to the website)
Posters,
Other mainstream propaganda.   


TL;DR Reddit should make the next KONY 2012.
  
**EDIT**: I have been made aware of a problem with this idea. If we were to raise money, and donate it to a different cause, it could be trouble. However, if we do chose to raise money, we could say that it is going to a real charity, i.e, red cross. That way we could raise money, and not have to lie about where it is going, that is, if we **choose** to raise money. 
 On a separate note, the idea of **Dihydrogen Monoxide** has been brought up many times. I think that this idea has potential, however, a simple Google search could be a problem.

For this idea to work, that page has to be altered. For this to happen, i propose a template be made, and we all submit it to the page in hopes of it being altered.

This video would need to be of high quality, and needs to make people want to act. In other words, it needs to do exactly what invisible children did with the KONY 2012 video. I suggest we make more than one, and have them posted in a separate thread, and the highest voted video would be used, on both our website, and on YouTube, Facebook, and other sites full of gullible people who won't do their research. If a few videos have been made, I will make a new thread to vote on them. Also, I can do the same if we have anyone who is willing to create  a professional website, with ""facts"" and ""statistics"" to convince the people. Once they have been chosen, we all spread both the video, and the website all over the internet.
Lastly, if this does gain any traction, merchandise should be designed and could be sold on the website. Anyone willing to design, and get those designs produced, could sell them on our website. If any other issues are brought up, expect another edit.

EDIT: And let me elaborate; rather than just saying I did not like it, I will tell you the reasons why:

1. If it is in fact a mockumentary, they should have focused a bit more on Thierry Guetta's background and family. I have a hard time believing that they would be doing all of this shit, and his family is an afterthought. Also, the fact that he just has all this money, and is able for all this shit to fall into place, highly unlikely. If it is a mockumentary, make it believable. I am positive that it is a mockumentary, done by Bansky to be a highly elaborate/ironic extension of his street art. It just follows.

2. However, if it is in fact a documentary (highly unlikely), then it is a joke, and it makes a joke of every single person appearing in the film. In this case, it's an even bigger piece of shit than if it is a mockumentary.

"Columbine happened because the kids listened to violent music, played violent video games, had antisocial tendencies, and were fascinated with anarchist culture. Although bullying may have contributed to it, it definitely wasn't the main culprit. 

Plenty of kids get bullied, and the vast majority don't shoot up schools. I offer you a counter example. The Virginia Tech shooter wasn't bullied at all, and he still killed 34 people. Crazy people be crazy. People shoot up schools because they want to be famous ""martyrs."" It's stupid but it's true. 

And my boyfriend didn't choose wrong. He chose smart. If you were offered a choice to either shoot a criminal, or be shot, you'd have to be pretty stupid to choose to be the one to get shot. Getting a philosophical point across isn't worth risking your well being for. It's basic survival instincts. 

Also, just in case you didn't know. Middle schools don't typically have witness protection programs. If he stuck up for the kid, he would have gotten his ass kicked, and if he tried to remain neutral, he would have been accused of supporting the kid, and gotten his ass kicked anyways.

Seriously, this is immature and goes to show that he cannot hack it on D3.",['MazInger-Z'],0,"A little backstory on these events in always nice, especially to someone like myself who hadn't been following anything related to the current situation.

However, the page seems to be down at the moment, so I grabbed the transcript from google's [cached page](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:4lbEVDxBxR8J:diablo.incgamers.com/blog/comments/interview-diablo-creator-david-brevik-discusses-his-feelings-on-diablo-3+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us) (which still allows you to watch the video of the interview).

&gt;IncGamers: You are very well known in the world of ARPGs, and I am going to ask you, Diablo 3 is probably the most anticipated PC title in 10 years. What’s your opinion on the final product?

&gt;David Brevik: Honestly, I think that they did a lot of the things the best they could, it was a very different game than I would have created, the team and personalities, the people, the talent and all the design philosophies of the people that worked on it in Irvine, we called them Blizzard South, those people have their own style and the their own way they like to design. It was very, very different from the Blizzard North.

&gt;So I think that when Blizzard South took over the development of Diablo 3 it was inevitable that they were going to create an experience that was in the Diablo theme but concentrated more towards the things that they liked to experience. Including more story and things like that.

&gt;When Blizzard North shut down they lost a ton of experience with why the Action RPG works and what about it works. That’s really difficult to recover from. They didn’t have the experience of people that knew it well. This is why you do things with random levels for example, and so when you lose that experience you are going to create a very different experience in the end than we would have created.

&gt;IncGamers: Do you think they bought the wrong people in? As we understand, Jay Wilson, for example, his background was RTS. From our point of view it looked like they misunderstood what kept people playing, The type of loot drops, which has been a big issues. One of the other issues is they have not listened to their community, and they have not anlaysed what makes up that addictive Diablo  experience. What are your thoughts on that?

&gt;David Brevik: Well, the loot system. They made some decisions with the loot system that were very different than the way that we did it in Diablo 2 and I think that obviously the community has been upset with some of the decisions they made. Having all of your powers work off your main weapon and things like that, to having blues that are more powerful than yellows. Eventually the auction house and how that worked, even something as simple as when you equip an item and it’s bound to your character permanently would  have totally changed the dynamic  of the game.

&gt;It seems odd that they have not really responded in a quick fashion to some of these things. I think they are very well aware of the problems at this point and are trying to fix some of this stuff. It’s a shame that they had to learn some of these painful lessons

&gt;IncGamers:  As you created Diablo, how do you feel about it? Do you feel a little let down that the legacy has kind of been mashed up?

&gt;David Brevik:  I have very mixed emotions about it (laughs). On one hand I am sad that people haven’t enjoyed Diablo because it’s a love, a passion, and its obvious people still have a giant love and passion for Diablo and they are speaking out about it because they have such love for it. That makes me feel great.

&gt;I am sad because people are outraged and, you know, some of the decision they have made are not the decisions I would make and there have been changes in philosophy and that hasn’t gone over very well. I think in that way I am a little sad.

&gt;I am also a little happy, which I hate to say, it shows that the people that were involved in Diablo really did matter, and so I am happy that it has come to light that how talented that group was and how unique and special that group was. I am hoping that, as this happens very often in the industry, you see it with Call of Duty and things like that ,  when the people leave the game changes and it shows how critical people are in this industry.

&gt;IncGamers:   One of the questions the Gazillion guys asked me to ask you was, where did the name Diablo come from?

&gt;David Brevik:  I thought of the game when I was in high school and I lived in the east part of San Francisco in a town called Danville and I loved at the base of Mount Diablo and that’s where the name comes from. Once I found out what the mountain name was, I thought that was awesome, I didn’t speak Spanish, so I thought I wanted to use that as a title for a nemesis in a videogame. It’s simply from where I lived.

 &gt;IncGamers:    Well thanks a lot David, you’ve brought a lot of pleasure to millions of people over the years and hopefully you’ll continue to do so.

**EDIT:**

A lot of people are asking for a **TL;DR**. So basically, it's just an interview with the mind behind D1/D2 saying how he feels the D3 team took the game in a different direction than he would have, and was a direction that ultimately disappointed fans of Diablo and of the ARPG genre. In my opinion, some of the parts seem sympathetic to the team but he also says he's a little pleased with the result, because it shows how integral and how important the original Diablo team was to the game and its success.

The D3 team took this interview as an insult and decided to rag on Brevik. The lead designer, Jay Wilson, even went so far as to say ""fuck that loser"" on facebook, though it was promptly removed after public discovery.

...

Although guys, I've gotta say... if you're actually interested in this conflict (as I was/am), then it wouldn't hurt to **read the transcript for yourself**. I just reread it, timing myself along the way. Under two minutes. This is light reading and doesn't really require a tl;dr in my opinion. I feel this is because the offensiveness of this interview is completely open to the reader's interpretation, and anyone's tl;dr attempting to explain emotion will indeed be just one interpretation of many.

"I read your post, then read the replies. I'm on your side, that would be awkward, but what did you expect? If redditors were all social and cool, then there wouldn't be a need for reddit meetups. It probably would have been better to first meet at someone's apartment for a pre-drink to do all that icebreaking stuff with the cards, and then venture off to the bar.

I've never thought reddit meetups were a good idea because you would have such a mixed bag come there. If you look at other forums (I'm a part of a car one), there are plenty of meetups and we talk about the thing we all have in common; cars. It gives us a natural common ground to then break into other topics and form a relationship. With reddit, the only thing everyone has in common are meme's and the inside jokes, which sound great online, but in real life they are kind of...lame.  ",['zoso471'],0,"So, our university subreddit decided to have a reddit meetup on Friday. A cookout at the park, followed by a meetup at a bar downtown for the over 21 crowd. I don't even browse my schools subreddit, but my roommates do, and for some reason, they wanted to go. 

We didn't go to the BBQ, and since it was Friday night, we just wanted to go to the bar anyway, so we ended up going to the bar that they were at. It was kind of quiet for 9PM on a Friday, so we ended up easily finding the ""reddit"" group, not only because the bar wasn't jam packed (yet) but because they had a ridiculous, glittery Reddit banner hanging above them at their table. 

We sit down. Right off the bat, I can tell things are going to be weird. I don't like to judge, to be honest, but I couldn't help but do that off the bat. Everyone seemed genuinely nice, but just....a little weird. Awkward is probably a better term to use at this point. 

Since it's a meetup, I'd expect everyone to just sort of introduce themselves to one another just like every other normal human being would do in a situation where you're meeting new people. Of course, being ""Redditors"", they couldn't be normal. They had nametags for everyone to fill out and wear on their shirts. Most of them had their reddit names on their nametag, which made it more pointless. Needless to say, I didn't play along and avoided the nametag ordeal. At this point, I was more interested in the Tigers vs White Sox game, and my drink. 

Of course, it didn't end there. Next up, the girl running the show busts out a card game. It wasn't like we were playing 5 card draw; no, it was a game similar to Apples to Apples, only worse. Only more...ehh...geared towards Reddit. I don't remember the name. 

After about 30 minutes of this shit, my one roommate got out of there in a non-awkward way, and we left to go to the other side of the bar. My other roommate, on the other hand, was winning the game, and having a good time. We left him behind and proceeded to get hammered to wash away the pain of sitting there.

Honestly, I'm a really nice guy. I get along with basically everybody. But bringing a card game to a bar is just plain stupid. If they wanted to do that, they should have just met up at someones apartment and dicked around with the stupid game there. On top of it, they were reading the cards all loud and shit, and laughing uncontrollably like they're never heard the word ""penis"" and ""four hour boner"" put together (that was one of the cards, somehow) 

So now, my general view is that people who go to Reddit meetups are going to be socially awkward, immature, people, who don't know how to generally interact with the rest of society and just have a good ole' time. Reddit is cool. I like Reddit. I like posting on Reddit. I like reading Reddit, and laughing at stupid shit, however, it doesn't mean I bring it into my every day life whenever I have a conversation with people. They were bringing up popular posts that have been on Reddit, and talking about that and stuff, and just overall making Reddit comparisons all the time. 

I pictured the meetup to be a bunch of Redditors getting together, meeting each other, having a few drinks, and an overall good time. Not, let's meet up at a bar and play a card game and act like we're in Middle School. It was like being at a bar with a bunch of 13 year olds who still think yelling ""penis"" is hilarious (at one point, they did that) 

At one point they ventured over to the other side of the bar before they left, and at this point, I was pretty intoxicated, so to avoid saying something stupid, I let me roommate handle it. He said they asked him he was ""upset"" and he said something to them like ""no, no, we were just bored and not really into the game and had other people we were meeting here (we didn't)"". 

So, I'm sure they're really good people, just socially awkward and ridiculously immature for their age. Oh yeah, not to judge (again) but the one guy was ""sipping"" a shot because it was ""really strong"". It was some banana mixed bullshit, too. That bothered me, so I told him to drink it like, well, you guessed it, A SHOT. 

I'm sure not all Reddit meetups are like this, but for me, I'm going to have to just assume they are awkward people that don't know how to socially interact completely. 

And if somehow, this gets to the frontpage, which I doubt it will because I never get there, and one of them sees this and figures out it was me, I really don't care. You guys deserve to read this and realize that what you were doing was just not the norm. Not that being apart from normal is wrong, but, it was just a weird experience. Try not to act like you're 13 in public, because you're not. You're 21, if not older, and you should try to at least halfway act your age. Not to mention, the only time you should act like a 13 year old idiot is if you're hammered drunk and not going to remember it the next day, which, none of you were. Unfortunately, I got hammered drunk after that, and I still remember it all (damn it..)

**TL;DR: went to my first Reddit meetup. They all acted awkward. We met at a bar, they played a card game, yelled ""PENIS"" really loud, laughed uncontrollably about immature stuff that a 13 year old might not even find funny, and overall, were just boring.**

However, in the world of software patents you can get a patent for simply ""creating light"" without any specific implementation.  This is the problem with software patents and should be dealt with.

JUST WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU FOR SUCH A GREAT RESPONSE.,['signorinapolpettina'],0,"You could ask 20 historians about the reasons for getting into WWII, and you would probably get 15 different answers.  Interpretations can basically be classed as Nationalist, Realist, and Radical.

Nationalist theories are the easiest theories to spot, because they are based on idealism.  Books which stress concepts like America's defense of the weak,  America's winning spirit, ect. can be classified as Nationalist.  The traditional nationalist view is that America is an isolationist country who is continually forced to act in foreign politics by beligerent nations.  The classic example of this is Dexter Perkin's ""Foreign Policy and the American Spirit"". Basically, it states that America was an innocent bystander who had to fight back after being attacked by the Japanese.

Realist writers are more focused on ""boots on the ground"".  Idealism is not a major factor in political decisions.  Power makes the decisions.  In Realist writings, Germany and Japan (and Italy to a lesser extent) built up power through their military.  They then used this power to extend their borders and spheres of influence. When their spheres of influence threatened other powers (U.S., Great Britain, U.S.S.R), these powers acted against them.  

If you want a great Realist perspective on WW2, read Gerhard Weinberg's A World At Arms.  It is 1000 pages of densely packed amazingness.  It details the lead up, the war and the aftermath in detail.  It's a tough read, but by god you will know your stuff when you finish.   

Radical perspectives focus on economic issues as deciding factors.  (I say ""radical"" instead of ""marxist"" because when I say marxist people look at me as if I havent bathed in a couple of weeks).  The best radical history I can remember reading was William Appleman William's The Tragedy of American Diplomacy.  He basically blames American involvement in WW2 as stemming from the Open Door Policy to China.  

The thing is, all of these interpretations are wrong.  And they are all right.  It's not a clear cut thing, it is a blending of all three into a perfect storm of war/death/genocide.

For further reading on WW2, I suggest John Dower's Embracing Defeat.  Good history of Japan in the last days and following the war.

Kurt's The Soviet Colossus is a good Russian perspective of the war.

Again, Gerhard Weinberg's A World at Arms is probably the best political history of WW2 I have ever read.  (and I actually read it, no matter what my professor says).

For fun, easy to read WW2 history, you can't go wrong with Steven Ambrose.  Band of Brothers, Citizen Soldiers, D-Day, etc.  He tends to repeat stories between books and also tends to lean toward the idealist nationalist theory but they're still good books.  I recommend these to people who want to 'read some history' 

For more Radical interpretations of the war and aftermath, read Gar Alperovitz. ""The decision to use the atomic bomb"", and ""Atomic diplomacy"".

"Biggest difference about cars and the iPhone...

You can modify a car and not get sued.",['victordavion'],0,"Two things about cars:

1. No one touts a single model as an [once] innovative, ""simply works"" car that has everything you need. Now the iPhone's lost ground, but what happened with the iPhone is people started looking at your Toyota and going ""Is that a Lexus?"" Seriously? It's a car, and specifically a Toyota, but thank you for noticing it's a new vehicle I recently purchased.

2. Most people don't buy the next year's model of the vehicle they already have, because the next year's model ultra rarely (ever?) has anything worth wasting money like that. Most cars can live 5, 10, 15 years or more before you *need* a new car. Probably at least 5 before features change enough that might warrant it, or maintenance becomes such an issue it becomes necessary; ideally that'd be closer to 10+. Same with phones. You *can* buy the next model (e.g. Samsung Galaxy S, S2, S3, etc), but is it worth the price? Or should you wait 2 years and pay an upgrade fee (far less than full retail), if not longer?

As for shoes? Well that varies, but they can wear out in less than a year -- usually because of crappy craftsmanship so, yes, buying new ones every year or two happens. They also get worn down from daily use; phones have less of a problem of wear unless you consider the gradual decline of batteries. Both products would ideally last longer than one or two years, but that certainly isn't guaranteed anywhere.

Phones should have a certain amount of longevity to them. Doesn't stop people beholden to any make and model or OS from deciding to upgrade annually, of course. Their money. Same as if someone bought a new car every year -- though that'd be a worse idea by far given the 'return' on selling the prior vehicle and for considerably less (I mean the iPhone 5 does at least come with LTE, so that's one feature people might really want the iPhone 4 didn't have; might be worth the $200 -- not that they'll get any more data allowance from their favorite carrier for all that speed).",2,2,StarlessKnight,0,-8

First off, that show is completely racist. How many times have you seen a black person win Cupcake Wars? Exactly.  
   
There was literally an episode where the contestants were making cupcakes for **The Black Film Festival** (of course, the black contestants was kicked off in the first round.) There was a white woman who literally made a collard green and grits flavored cupcake with sweet potato and black eyed peas on top. It's episode five of the Cupcake Wars collection on the USA Netflix if you want to see for yourself.
    
Also, the ridiculous amount of fuck ups on that show blows my mind. These people's make a living creating cupcakes, but as soon as they get on this show they completely forget how to make tiny pieces of cake. So many episodes people forget to add sugar or butter or something ridiculously fucking simple. Cupcakes are not that hard. I make cupcakes sometimes, and I've never fucked up as bad as people who have made their career around making a cupcake.   
    
And the fucking judges. Jesus Christ they're terrible. The guest judge, whoever they are, always looks like they would rather be anywhere else than on the show. You can see it in their eyes every time they open their mouths to talk about how the cupcake tastes. When they're saying ""Umm...yeah, I guess I liked it?"" you can tell they're thinking ""how fucking far did my career fall to be on this shitshow?""   
There's Candace who is boring as hell, she's like a not drunk/not fun Paula Abdul, she wants to be everybody's friend. ""Your cupcake made me vomit out of my mouth and asshole, but the decoration you put on top is so cute I say you get an A for effort!""    
But they all pale in comparison to [ that douchey French fuck, Florian](https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.charitybuzz.com/images/53215/original.jpg?1384619881). Oh my god I cannot stand him. ""Zees cupcake ehhh....[unrecognizable syllables strung together]...terribell! Zeh frosteeng is not uh salty enough and...[more unrecognizable syllables strung together]...I weesh you would 'av shit on zees cupcake, zen eet would be delicious."" I get these people have a *refined palate* but come on, it's a fucking cupcake. And this show is a joke. And you are a joke. Fuck you Florian. 
   
    
And I am so fucking sick of seeing zoomed in shots of these people shoveling gross cupcakes into their mouths. I bet there's at least 4-5 minutes of the show of watching the judges chew food.    
    
But what do I hate the most? Myself. Because I keep fucking watching the show.    
   
Fuck Cupcake Wars. I love cupcakes, and I love competitive cooking shows, but at what cost?

I would advise against being so flatfooted, simple-minded and narrow in your viewpoint.

Discrimination against women isn't a myth just because you scrounged up some cases of men being treated poorly. It's a reality that I and millions of other women live.",['[deleted]'],0,"&gt; men, who are outside of certain situations doing pretty well in today's society

This is a common myth, and I don't blame you for believing it.

By any quantifiable (real) metric of happiness and success, men are far worse off.

Just a short list of inequalities affecting men that are largely ignored by society, due to the outdated, but still falsely propagated myth of male ""privilege"":

* [80% of suicides are by men](http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/suicide-in-the-us-statistics-and-prevention/index.shtml#risk)

* [93% of workplace deaths and injuries have a male victim](http://i.imgur.com/gQtnE.png)

* Even though [women are statistically shown to be the primary abusers of children](http://i.imgur.com/TgBU8.png) (page 39 of [this study](http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cb/pubs/cm09/cm09.pdf)), family courts are biased against men in custody disputes, and women are generally given default custody.

* Men have zero reproductive rights, and are held financially accountable for children they never wanted, in a disturbing number of cases [even underage rape victims have been forced to pay child support to their rapist](http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2008/08/16/janecrane.ART_ART_08-16-08_B1_T0B1RSR.html) (just google: boy forced to pay child support to rapist, the amount of results are disturbing)

* [Only 43% of University attendees are male.](http://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2005-10-19-male-college-cover_x.htm)

* [The Gender Literacy Gap](http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/research/boys_literacy.pdf)

&gt;Also, more males declared themselves to be “non readers” and were more likely to be secondary school dropouts (66%). In 2002 (Raymond 2008), 11% more female students than males met the expected level in writing.

* [The criminal sentencing gender gap](http://digitalcommons.utep.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1001&amp;context=gang_lee&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Furl%3Fsa%3Dt%26rct%3Dj%26q%3Dsentencing%2520gender%2520disparities%26source%3Dweb%26cd%3D1%26ved%3D0CCkQFjAA%26url%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fdigitalcommons.utep.edu%252Fcgi%252Fviewcontent.cgi%253Farticle%253D1001%2526context%253Dgang_lee%26ei%3DoeRgT8DaHcuosAKC7d2WCA%26usg%3DAFQjCNH8Q8gfgFry6_Hb2FbTQ_a3l-TfBQ#search=%22sentencing%20gender%20disparities%22)

* [The majority of homeless persons are male. (roughly 60%)](http://www.nationalhomeless.org/factsheets/who.html)

&gt;Most studies show that single homeless adults are more likely to be male than female. In 2007, a survey by the U.S. Conference of Mayors found that of the population surveyed 35% of the homeless people who are members of households with children are male while 65% of these people are females. However, 67.5% of the single homeless population is male, and it is this single population that makes up 76% of the homeless populations surveyed (U.S. Conference of Mayors, 2007).

* Non-consensual genital mutilation is practiced exclusively on boys in Western cultures.

* The media generally portrays men as dumb and ineffectual, while violence against men is normalized as ""humorous"". As a telling example, a popular TV show had an entire segment in which they laughed about a man having his penis chopped off and thrown in the garbage disposal. ([skip to 4:45 to see the clip](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP4VeMJp9pE))

* Gendered legislation such as VAWA and law enforcement policies such as The Duluth Model (google these, please) have lead to male victims of domestic violence being arrested when they rely on law enforcement for help. Can you imagine the trauma of being a victim of violence, yet being the one arrested by police?

The ""certain situations"" you referenced are more prevalent than you might think, but it is not your fault if you didn't know the magnitude of the inequality that men face in today's society. Hope this helped!

AS BAND-AID SUPPLIER MYSELF, I CAN COMPLETELY CONFIRM THIS

IF I SEE A FAT PERSON AT A WALGREEN'S SCARFING DOWN SOME CONDOMS, I'M GOING TO BE A JUDGEMENTAL ARSEHOLE.

IF I SEE A FAT PERSON AT A WALGREEN'S, ACTUALLY WORKING UP A SWEAT, I'M THINKING ""GOOD ON YA, MATE"".",['wingsofseraphim'],0,"Well, I certainly applaud anyone wanting to eat 100 Band-Aids, but take it from this old nurse rat, I've spent my entire adult life eating Band-Aids, and a program like this one can do more harm than good.

If you only absorb Band-Aids with one part of your body (and that's all a single-Band-Aid type exercise like eating novocaine is going to do for you), you're setting yourself up for injuries down the road. I've seen it a hundred times.

Eating Band-Aids basically only trains the mouth and to some extent, the throat. What you really want to do is train all of your body parts, all the major coverable areas (face, arms, legs, and chest, ect.) at the same time, over the course of using up an entire pharmecy warehouse. So, you will need to add different size Band-Aids and plaster for safety. Ask for the ""mummification"" program.

I'm proud of you guys wanting to do this. Big Band-Aids! Falling in love with eating Band-Aids, etc., is one of the greatest things you can do for yourself. And you WILL fall in love with it if you can just force yourself to stick with it a year or two and experience the amazing progress you'll make.

But do it right, okay?

My advice, find any pharmacy near you, with qualified suppliers who will design your Band-Aid eating regimen for you (especially in the beginning, until you get the hang of it yourself) and guide you in your quest for eating Band-Aids. 30 to 45 Band-Aids a day, three days a week, is all you'll ever need to do (I refuse to believe anyone is so busy that he or she cannot make time for that, especially considering how important it is).

And don't worry about being embarrassed or not having a covered face the first time you walk into the medical complex. You have to start somewhere and almost every one of us were there ourselves at one time. So no one will say anything to you and very, very quickly you will progress way beyond that stage anyway.

He used to hang out in the Vent that I ran and at some point or another I ended up telling him to go to hell and kicking him out of our Vent, I think because he was acting superior to everyone else, or possibly just me.
Either way, it turned out he was a programmer in the real world and he hacked into our Vent, gave himself admin and banned all of us instead. I ended up having to beg his forgiveness or something. It was pretty scary that people can actually do things like that with computers and I've spent a lot of time trying to find out what he actually did, but can't.

ORIENTAL? WHAT THE FUCK? WHAT YEAR IS IT AGAIN?,['AzMoo'],0,"I think what a lot of the Oriental nations and some European nations get right is that they build networks and initially aim them at the cities and then expand as they make more money

In Japan, Korea and China they are rolling out these services in big cities and over the years they will profit from that infrastructure and use that profit to lay down fiber optic cable. Once that fiber optic infrastructure is there you will be able to tweak and play with it to improve its speeds over the years and decades.

The 1Gbps internet connections in South Korea and Japan are using the same fiber optic cable they used for 100Mbps and 1Gbps certainly isn't the limit for fiber optic cable. Just like copper once they have the infrastructure in place they can keep improving it and it will benefit them for decades.

Of course building a fiber optic cable network that covers the whole of the US is a lofty ambition. However building fiber optic networks that cover Chicago, LA, New York and other densely populated places, profiteering from those investments and then over the years and decades getting the rest of the country upto speed.. that just might work.

I honestly don't think they have added any new features since XP. I can do all these things(accept the visual stuff) in XP. ,['tdrusk'],0,"Installed it on a second partition on my Acer Aspire One (little netbook).  It works well.  Aero is enabled by default.  Task manager shows the CPU is always being used to about 10%, but it might be the indexing running in the background.  Apps that are closed and then opened again open faster than in Windows XP (the other OS installed on it).  Installation was straighforward and all my devices were installed (no need for additional drivers or anything).  

The taskbar looks good.  Can be confusing for the first 5 minutes, but the ability to move things around is neat.    You can open an application, then right click it and select ""pin to taskbar"" and it makes it a permanent quick launch icon.  Very intuitive.  Passing the mouse over an icon has a neat lighting effect.  Placing the mouse at the right of the taskbar for a second will reveal the desktop and all the gadgets.  Again, very smart.  Mocing the windows to one side will resize it to fit exactly on half the screen.  Very useful during file transfers.  

Loading the OS is as fast (if not faster) than XP right now, but I haven't installed all my programs yet; so those that open at startup aren't right now.  But going from bios to OS screen to login screen is faster in Windows 7.  

Aero is a bit choppy but not slow, but that was fully expected.  The Intel GMA chip is a just a little bit underpowered; but it still works.

Install size is approx. 6GB.  I'll do some more testing (mainly, see if I can play HD movies still).

- single-party
- indoctrination (religious right, Fox News, Tea Party rhetoric)
- family policy (e.g., traditional marriage, anti-abortions)

- organic unity based on ancestry, race, blood (anti-immigrant, anti-Islam, ""learn to speak English"")
- militarism
- reject egalitarianism and rationalism in favour of action, discipline, hierarchy, spirit, and will.
- oppose liberal economics

Why is it necessary for me to eat a so-called ""regular person's diet"" like you and everyone else? The only nutrient that you can't get from a vegan diet is vitamin B12, and I'm taking that in the form of three different supplements (multivitamin, B vitamin, and methylcobalamin). *Everything else* you need can be obtained by eating the right fruits, vegetables, and so forth. There is no need for meat or dairy products in the human diet, and in fact our evolutionary ancestors [did not consume meat and ate mostly fruit](http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30813FB3F5D12728DDDAC0994DD405B898BF1D3&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=Teeth+Show+Fruit+Was+The+Staple&amp;st=p), similarly to modern day monkeys. In fact, due to its cholesterol content, red meat is actually quite detrimental to human health (though not other meats like poultry or fish), and the FDA advises that you should eat it sparingly, if at all.

In any case, again, as I mentioned to someone else here, my decision not to eat meat in general isn't a matter of health, it's due to my own *personal* ethical values. I will not eat meat simply because I feel that it is wrong, and that is all. This should be fairly obvious, and you have no right to discriminate against me for that when I have done nothing to you.

Now can we all please lay off the fact that I'm vegan? Thanks.

1. [Wolf-whistling 'could be made illegal' under new European convention ](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/qnwfj/wolfwhistling_could_be_made_illegal_under_new/). How dare they try to eliminate sexual harassment!

2. [AVfM Radio: Does Feminism cause brain damage?](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/qnz9a/avfm_radio_does_feminism_cause_brain_damage/). No comment necessary.

3. [International Women's Day Month at my work: women only](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/qnkyu/international_womens_day_month_at_my_work_women/) Oh lawdy

4.

Another thread about the dangers of eliminating sexual harassment

5. [It's international women's day and my daughters birthday, but my ex-wife won't let me see her.](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/qntoc/its_international_womens_day_and_my_daughters/)

6. [Husband charged for investigating adulterous wife.](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/qnvf7/husband_charged_for_investigating_adulterous_wife/). Here's the actual title of that article: ""Man accused of hiding transmitter under wife's bed"". A better thread title might be: man charged with a crime. I should note that the couple was separated during this incident. He hid it under her bed, not their bed.

7. [""Gamestop will always hire a woman over a male. Even if the male has a huge amount of experience, knowledge of video games, and isn't a social retard. It's just how corporate works.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/qmjfa/gamestop_will_always_hire_a_woman_over_a_male/).

9.

10. [a first in Switzerland- Zurich appoints male affairs officer ](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/qn1js/a_first_in_switzerland_zurich_appoints_male/). I wasn't going to link this thread, because I thought this looked legit. It's genuinely promoting men's issues. Hurrah!

"There's various Articles that all NATO members have to agree to.

The most important are Articles 4-5. 4 stipulates that any NATO member nation can call an emergency meeting to which representatives from all other member nations must attend. (Hillary is going to Germany right now I think).

Article 5 is the big guns. It essentially states that any attack on a NATO member nation is an attack on them all. If Turkey invokes article five, half the western world will be going to war with Syria. Now, these clauses don't kick in automatically when someone gets attacked. The subject nation must invoke the clauses. 

We will back Turkey up if they invoke Article 5. The whole purpose of NATO is to provide military support, and these countries stay in NATO because they know they have some of the largest military might in history looking out for them.

At this point in my life, I know I am heading to college soon, I only have a few months of high school left and I am sure there is nothing left to learn from my parents.

We arrive on campus in the late afternoon and do a self-guided tour: see a couple of quads, the math and physics buildings, talk to a few people and see the inside of dorm, etc.  7pm comes and we decide to get dinner.  We ask someone where the main thoroughfare is and head over to grab some food at a delicious smelling gyro place.  We order and and are standing around waiting for our food when a homeless man wanders in and starts asking people for money.  Most of the people do that standard bit of avoiding eye contact and straining to ignore his presence.

I come from a decently sheltered background (though I didn't know it at the time) and so my brain goes into fight-or-flight mode and I am looking for a way to hide from or escape any interactions with the homeless guy.  I figure my dad would do that same thing.  Instead, he walks up to the guy and asks, ""are you hungry?""

The homeless man affirms this and my dad asks, ""I could buy you a meal if that would be alright with you.""  They go over and look at a menu and the guy orders a medium classic gyro with a side fries and a drink - exactly the same thing I ordered.  The man thanked my dad and my dad asked him if there was anything else he wanted?  He asked if we could give him a few dollars.  My dad responded, ""I will buy you as much food as you want, but I'm not gonna give you any money.""

When the orders came up, the homeless guy thanked my dad again and my dad shook his hand and wished him luck; he had treated the homeless man a human instead of a nuisance.  It was the last thing my dad taught me before I went off to college and began my life as an adult and I doubt he even remembers it.  

I found out later he has done this numerous times in the past for lots of people down on their luck, I just was too young to noticed or was already in the car or maybe he was trying to hide the hardship of others from me.

It sounds like you've put a lot of effort into this. The fact that you were able to make your rent and related expenses despite being a complete newcomer speaks to your business skills. 12 clients in 10 days is actually outstanding! Considering that you could have failed completely, you should be proud of yourself. You should consider starting your own non-sex related business - you would probably do quite well with that. 

Since you now have a way to generate income, I suggest using the rule of thirds, something I picked up from Tony Robbins. Whatever you have left after paying expenses, divide it into thirds. Set aside one third for starting a business or any other investment that comes along a the right time. Another third you should put into a low-risk or no-risk account like a savings account. The last third put into an account for dreams and fun, things like caribbean vacation, dream car, whatever you want. It's okay if the amounts that go into these accounts are small at first - the idea is the thing, and as you start generating more income you may get more and different ideas. 

Thanks for answering, and good luck!

The REASON they could not walk was that their mother refused to let them walk, and would insist on strapping them into a double stroller whenever they were not sleeping.  The reason they could not talk is that she would not talk to them in anything but some crazy language involving a lot of grunting, that she apparently 
invented herself.  She was collecting large amounts  of social security and disability payments for both of her ""disabled"" children.  They lived in a private gated community, and she drover a nicer car than any of the staff at the school.

"Patents are not granted for ""respect"". They are a carrot on a stick to encourage ""innovation"". They exist to benefit society, not companies and not individuals. If this carrot-on-a-stick is not actually needed, then the patent is harmful and should be abolished.

The only relevant question is ""Is it economically possible to develop these drugs without the incentive of a 14-20 year monopoly on the invention""

The answer is often yes. For example, look at software patents. IBM will take the patents that result from ***grad students working at universities under grants derived from PUBLIC FUNDS***. It's a patronage system. What the fuck is the use of the patent there? Absolutely none. The public is already funding the research, so the invention belongs to the public domain. Instead, a huge corporation gets a 2-decade monopoly.

1. Just because a generic version is available does not mean that the brand name earns $0. Being first to market is quite powerful, and so is brand strength. Fucking Tylenol makes tons of money without a patent on acetaminophen, even though the generic stuff is half the price! The 'original' may earn less because of the knock-offs, but it does not earn $0. The only question, again, is ***Can these reduced profits fund continued development***?

2. The pharmaceutical industry is hardly innocent in their use of patents. They're not using them to ""just make an honest buck"" for poor, hardworking scientists. You know what they do when their patents run out? They bundle 2 old patents together into a new one! Slight changes and...BAM...fresh monopoly for another 2 decades. They fight tooth and nail to control as much as they possibly can and must be fought back against.",['desu_desu'],0,"Ok, so what you're saying is all the money spent on R&amp;D is now gone.

You can't just create these drugs out of nowhere.  They take _lots_ of money and time to make, and if you want to see the large pharma corporations fund more research, you sure as hell shouldn't let a small company steal their drug design.

Basically, several teams of researchers just had _years_ if not _decades_ of hard work stolen from them.

The Bible says incest is okay. So.......,['Didiyoso'],0,"&gt; Islam doesn't allow any of the stuff

Nonsense. The religion spread because Mohammed was a warlord. The Quran is pretty clear about that! Mohammed conquered Mecca and Arabia and that is how the religion originated. 

Furthermore, the Quran condones things such as raping your slaves (and only non-Muslims can be slaves). Cf. Ma malakat aymanukum

Mohammed himself was a pedophile who [""married"" a 6 year old girl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aisha) when he was in his 40ies (but in his defense, he only started raping her when she was 9).


Many modern Muslims (such as Alawi, which you would probably not consider ""Muslim"") reject this and would find raping a 9 year old as abhorrent. ",20,20,rh3ss,0,-8

Oh man this is such a wonderfully terrible story. Thanks for sharing,['kalari-'],0,"i have a pretty good one this week. very awkward.

so i'm at my apartment building's gym, which is pretty small, but whatever. I am doing upper back, rear delts, trying to fix that hunch, and a couple is using the machine on which i'd like to do rear delt flies - an asian girl and a white dude (this will become relevant).

Just as I finish my last set at the free weights, I see the girl walk away from the machine, over to the other side of the weight rack. Then I put my stuff away and ask her if she's done. She looks at me confused. ""Huh?""
""Are you done with the machine?""
""What?""

At this point I feel like I am doing something wrong, but can't quite locate it. Then some other guy comes up and starts explaining that he and his girlfriend want to use the machine later, if that's what I'm asking. I am even more confused now - this is not what I'm asking, in fact why would I even care about it? I have never seen this guy before. I tell him politely but firmly that this is not what I'm asking, and that I am asking the girl, not him, a question.

Then I glance back towards the machine. The original couple is still there. But the asian girl and the random dude are right in front of me. Suddenly it hits me - THERE ARE TWO ASIAN GIRLS, TWO INTERRACIAL WHITE/ASIAN COUPLES. Somehow in my eagerness to use the machine I assumed the asian girl in the corner of my eye was the same as on the machine. Honestly, I have no idea how I made the mistake other than that I was a little hungover and spacey and, in all fairness, they looked pretty similar!

So as soon as it dawns on me what's happening I apologize profusely to what I now realize is an entirely different couple couple, and start to explain my mistake, which quickly becomes clear is not a good move itself. Awkward stuff. I slink over to the machine to ask the original interracial couple when they'll be finished. As I wait shamefaced on the far wall I remember a particular comment of mine - ""I'm sorry but I was asking her"", in response to the then unknown boyfriend's intervention. It must have sounded like I was directly trying to hit on his girlfriend and put him down in front of her. What I had meant as a firm comment might, in my confusion, have come off as more antagonistic than intended.

"APPARENTLY YOU WERE BRAINWASHED BY PROGRESSIVIST PHILOSOPHY. LET ME BREAK YOU SOMETHING: MOST WOMEN WILL NEVER GIVE YOU ENTHUSIASTIC CONSENT BEYOND ALL DOUBT, BECAUSE THEY FEEL THEY WILL BE SEEN AS WHORES IF THEY SIGNAL THAT THEY LIKE SEX TOO MUCH. SO THEY WILL USUALLY PRETEND TO RESIST, IN ORDER TO SAVE FACE, WHILE OF COURSE GIVING ALL SORTS OF SUBTLE SIGNALS THAT IS NOT TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY.

AT SOME LEVEL IT IS SCREWED UP, AS IT CAN BE SEEN AS THE RESULT OF A CULTURE THAT TELLS WOMEN THEY ARE WHORES IF THEY LIKE SEX. BUT IT IS THE WAY IT IS, AND BECAUSE IT IS SO, HALF OF THE CONSENSUAL SEX ACTS OUT THERE ARE ACTUALLY WITH PRETENDED RESISTANCE, AND THE OTHER HALF IS WITHOUT ENTHUSIASTIC CONSENT TOO.

"I DID A WHOLE [WRITE-UP](HTTP://WWW.REDDIT.COM/R/ASKREDDIT/COMMENTS/2M2CVE/WHAT_WEBSITE_HAD_THE_GREATEST_FALL_FROM_GRACE/CM0CX3M) ON THIS ONCE BEFORE:

&GT; DIGG'S FALL WAS ACTUALLY A PRETTY INTERESTING ""CASE STUDY"" ON THE DANGEROUS OF TRYING TO MONETIZE A WEBSITE TOO MUCH TOO FAST.
&GT; 
&GT; THE FALL STARTED A GOOD TWO-THREE YEARS BEFORE THE ACTUAL IMPLOSION, WHEN DIGG BEGAN LOOKING FOR GROWTH CAPITAL. THEY SOLD OFF A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THEIR INTERESTS IN EXCHANGE FOR THIS CAPITAL (OVER THE COURSE OF THREE SEPARATE DEALS, CULMINATING IN A $30M IN EXCHANGE FOR AN UNDISCLOSED SHIT-TON OF EQUITY ONE IN LATE 2008) , AND THE VC BRIGADE TOOK THE WHEEL TO A MACHINE THEY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND.
&GT; 
&GT; ON THE WEB, IF A WEBSITE IS ""FREE"", IT'S BECAUSE THE USER ISN'T THE CUSTOMER. THE USER IS THE PRODUCT. THAT'S A TRUTH THAT MOST PEOPLE KNOW AND UNDERSTAND, BUT ACCEPT NO LESS BECAUSE HAVING YOUR EYES SOLD ON SOMEONE ELSE'S BEHALF ISN'T SO BAD IF THEY PROVIDE A WORTHWHILE PRODUCT IN RETURN. TAKE REDDIT. WE'RE THE PRODUCT BEING SOLD TO ADVERTISERS. BUT REDDIT IS A GOOD WEBSITE WITH INTERESTING CONTENT, AND THE ""SELLING"" OF OUR EYES GOES BY LARGELY UNNOTICED. EVEN IF IT IS THE ENDGAME, IT'S NOT OBVIOUS TO THE USER.
&GT; 
&GT; THE DIGG VC GROUP (HIGHLAND CAPITAL PARTNERS WAS THE MAIN FIRM, THERE WERE A FEW IN THE MIX THOUGH) DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF MAKING SURE THE USER DOES NOT FEEL LIKE A PRODUCT. THEY ASSUMED THAT, BECAUSE DIGG WAS SO POPULAR, IT WOULD JUST STAY THAT WAY. THE ACTUAL CONTENT WAS IRRELEVANT, PEOPLE WOULD COME TO DIGG BECAUSE IT WAS DIGG.
&GT; 
&GT; SO, INSTEAD OF CONTINUING THE PATH OF ORGANIC, USER-DRIVEN CONTENT, THEY FIGURED ""CONTENT IS CONTENT"" AND TOOK THAT CONTROL OUT OF THE USER'S HANDS. THEY PUT IT INTO THE HANDS OF ""POWER USERS"" ORIGINALLY, THEN EVEN LESS SO AND MORE INTO THE HANDS OF ANYONE WITH A FEW BUCKS TO THROW THEIR WAY.
&GT; 
&GT; IMAGINE HOW DIFFERENT REDDIT'S FRONT PAGE WOULD LOOK IF IT WAS RANKED BY HOW MUCH GOLD WAS SPENT ON ANY GIVEN LINK. IT WOULD BE MADE 100% OUT OF THINLY VEILED ADS. NOTHING WOULD BE ON THE FRONT PAGE UNLESS IT WAS TRYING TO SELL YOU SOMETHING.
&GT; 
&GT; WELL, THAT'S THE DIRECTION DIGG TOOK THINGS IN. AND IT WAS A DISASTER. SO THEY TRIED TO BACKPEDDLE. MORE DISASTER. THE V4 OVERHAUL WAS THE NAIL IN THE COFFIN, THOUGH. ALL OF THIS VC NONSENSE WAS LEADING UP TO V4...WHICH WAS RUSHED THROUGH DEVELOPMENT BY NONE OTHER THAN THE VC GROUPS WHO WERE RUNNING THE SHOW.
&GT; 
&GT; THEY CUT THE BUDGET ON THE DEVELOPMENT DRAMATICALLY, REMOVING MOST OF THE QA PROCESS AND FORCING THE THING OUT THE DOOR WELL BEFORE IT WAS READY FOR PRIME TIME.
&GT; 
&GT; THE RESULT? V4 WAS A SHIT SHOW. IT BROKE EVERY 10 MINUTES, WAS DOWN FOR HOURS ON END, AND ON TOP OF IT ALL...IT WAS A SHITTY DESIGN.
&GT; 
&GT; POP QUIZ HOTSHOT: YOU'RE THE DIRECTOR OF A MAJOR WEBSITE THAT, WHILE ONCE-INVINCIBLE, IS NOW HEMORRHAGING USERS ON A DAILY BASIS. WHAT IS THE ONE THING THAT WILL SOLIDIFY YOUR DEMISE?
&GT; 
&GT; TIME'S UP.
&GT; 
&GT; THE ANSWER? DOWNTIME. WELL, DOWNTIME IN CONJUNCTION WITH A VIABLE COMPETITOR. YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE VIABLE COMPETITOR RIGHT NOW. WHEN THE CURTAINS WENT UP ON THE V4 SHIT SHOW (AND DOWN, AND UP, AND DOWN, AND UP), REDDIT DIDN'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING BUT KEEP THE LIGHTS ON. THE GREAT DIGG V4 EXODUS WAS THE CULMINATION OF TWO YEARS' WORTH OF BAD DECISIONS ON THE PART OF DIGG AND ITS INVESTORS. MORE SO THE INVESTORS, BUT DIGG'S ORIGINAL STAFF MADE A BAD CHOICE TO JOIN THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE, AND ANOTHER ONE WHEN THEY GAVE UP AS MUCH CONTROL AS THEY DID.
&GT; 
&GT; LOOK AT REDDIT IN CONTRAST. THEY'VE JUST RECEIVED A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY, BUT GAVE UP VERY LITTLE CONTROL. THEY RECENTLY PULLED IN 50 MILLION ON A 500 MILLION DOLLAR VALUATION. DIGG, AT ITS HIGH POINT, HAD A VALUATION OF AROUND 150M. THE HIGHLAND CAPITAL DEAL BROUGHT IN ABOUT 30M, IN ADDITION TO THE 15-20M THEY ALREADY HAD OUTSTANDING WITH OTHER INVESTORS. THE VALUATION THAT THE HC DEAL GAVE WASN'T DISCLOSED, BUT IT WAS ALMOST CERTAINLY LESS THAN 150M (MY GUESS IS THAT AN UNPROFITABLE COMPANY WITH 8M IN REVENUE DIDN'T GET MORE THAN A 100M VALUATION). DIGG EASILY HAD OVER 50% OF THEIR EQUITY TIED UP IN VC...AND THOSE WERE THE PEOPLE PULLING THE STRINGS ALL THE WAY UP TO THE V4 IMPLOSION (INDEED, INVESTORS ""FIRED"" TWO CEOS, ONE BEING KEVIN ROSE HIMSELF, OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT THREE YEARS).
&GT; 
&GT; A LOT OF PEOPLE AT DIGG SAW THE WRITING ON THE WALL WELL-BEFORE IT WENT TITS UP. THERE WERE A NUMBER OF HIGH-RANKING STAFF MEMBERS LEAVING THE COMPANY, DEVELOPERS TALKING ABOUT A SHITTY ENVIRONMENT...ALL KINDS OF ""BAD OMENS"".
&GT; 
&GT; THE ACTUAL FALL WAS DEFINITELY FAST-AND-HARD, MUCH LIKE THE FALL OF, SAY, ENRON. BUT THE BUILD-UP WAS SPECTACULAR. I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT A NUMBER OF PEOPLE DIDN'T SEE THIS COMING A GOOD YEAR BEFORE IT HAPPENED. I'M SURE THERE WAS SOMEONE WHO LOOKED AT THE HIGHLAND CAPITAL DEAL AND THOUGHT ""THIS IS OUR POISON PILL RIGHT HERE. THIS IS WHAT WILL KILL US"".

If you've ever read up on any serial killers/sociopaths you'll notice some common traits.


1. They want attention and recognition for their crimes. 
This guy delivers no useful advice for OP but decides to tell his story in all its ""glory"" just like someone who took their parents car out for a joy ride. You know, the whole ""I did something bad and shouldn't have done it, but look at all the shit I did and I got away with it too!! How cool and calculating of me!! I thought of all the details and even covered MY OWN ASS. LOOK AT ME! Did I mention I'm good looking? Educated? Have connections? Beautiful wife now....life is good, no PTSD for me :). Fucker.


2. They use techniques of neutralization and try to rationalize their crimes. 
He was in a ""dark place"" and had to wear ""a mask."" These were introverted girls, anyone can get a slut or sorority girl. Yeah what I did was wrong Reddit, but it's not like ruining someones life...just a bad time in my life. Bastard.

3. These people don't have ""fits"" or ""phase out of crime."" 
He was a serial rapist. He still is and will be a serial rapist.

Guess what? It's very true that reddit is functionally better better than Digg, for reasons that I won't go into here. However, it's also true that a social news website is heavily reliant on its community, and with the honest new Diggers it seems have come a few bad apples.

Here's what you can do to stop them and keep reddit intellectual:

**Downvote polls** - Reddit is not the venue for polls, both because it is a poor medium, and because it blocks better contents from making it. Polls are a simple karma whoring attempt, and does not provide new content that benefits the reddit community in any way.

**Read Comments** - The latest reddit poll had the following comment:

&gt;AxiomShell 249 points 12 hours ago
&gt;
&gt;Vote down either way.

With 449 downvotes and 1633 upvotes, AxiomShell has still managed to gather 249 points in a comment that directly defies the logic of the post. Even assuming every downmodder voted AxiomShell up, than still means that about *1400 upmodders* couldn't be bothered to make a conscious decision one way or another about polls. This is clearly unacceptable, and is hurting reddit. I understand if you're new to reddit, and don't realize the flaws involved, but that's the purpose of this post. Please do what you can to act logically and rationally as to what's best for the community.

In addition, intelligent commenters are what makes the reddit community great.

**Stop Caring About Karma**: Those funny pictures may have great mass appeal, but do you really want to reduce your best chance for self enlightenment into little more than a glorified home for email forwards?

Stretch yourself, next time you see that hilarious picture. Don't submit it. It won't hurt reddit not to see it. You don't really need the karma. Every time you feel compelled to submit easy karma via a picture, do something else: *find something that makes you think.*

Call a house meeting. You guys can't go on talking about this behind your friend's back. For all you know he might think he's totally in the right. 

1. Rent alone? As long as his 1/4 is covered, well I'd keep that a separate issue. It's up to you, but personally I think that rent for him is 1/4, so leave it at that. If you get them to pay more on this issue won't help much because divide by three how much extra they pay and you'll see that for the other three of ya'll it won't add up to help you much. Say they pay $75 extra for her... that only brings your personal rent stake down to $350. And you've raised the animosity in the house a bit. When you have 4-5 people sharing the house, you can't have nagging issues, it'll just bring about bad feelings. Gotta treat everything like a team issue. Gotta create buy-in and get everyone on board.

2. Utilities and any other bills. These are where they should really pay more. (this is what I've done twice and it worked well with all of us) Take the sum of all other bills for water, power, trash etc... divide by 5 now, and together the couple should pay their 2/5's. This is only fair. She will be showering, using the electricity and now she's one more body taking up time in the bathroom, the kitchen etc.

3. House supplies. This is what I suggest: Anyone and everyone can buy ""house supplies"". We kept a white board and a box in the kitchen. If you buy a ""house supply"" (batteries, food, paper towels, toilet paper whatever) You write the item, and cost on the board, receipt goes in the box. End of the month, you figure out what each person's total is, and you fix the average. We did this every month and it worked great. If you bought $25 worth of stuff, and no one else did, everyone chips you $5. It's easy, and it really spreads the cost out of stuff that can REALLY add up fast.

3. Get a maid. Seriously. Look at craigslist. They are CHEAP. Like $100 or so. You now have 5 people living in the house. For a simple $40 a month you could have someone come every two weeks and clean your house spotless. This will reduce house friction SO much. I'm totally serious. It worked wonders for us. If someone's a bit dirty, well now it's not a huge deal because at least the house is cleaned professionally twice a month. It's also a common good that helps everyone, reduces workload, and if she agrees to pay 1/5 of the maid, it's good for her and your buddy too. It shows some commitment to the rest of the house that she knows she's an extra burden in the house, but she's willing to help. It'll save face for your buddy, because it gives him an ""out"" so to speak, that he is right about the rent, while helping everyone else out and paying her fair share at the same time.

"""texting him constantly... over a decade ago."" Am I that old? Is texting that old???",['alxhghs'],0,"I was a crazy ex. I have no fucking clue what came over me. He was my first serious boyfriend, and both being in our late teens, we sort of outgrew each other after 18 months. We split up amicably, and remained close for a while, but we kept slipping back into the casual affection we'd always shown each other - we'd be walking together and suddenly realise we were holding hands. We agreed to put some distance between us to help us both move on. 

That's when the crazy hit me. I don't really want to go into detail, but I did all the classic crazy ex things - texting him constantly, threatening suicide etc. I plummeted into a deep depression and somehow blamed him for it while believing that we could get back together, despite the relationship having come to it's natural end. It felt like a bereavement to me. I don't remember how I came out of crazy mode. I guess it just wore off after a while. I'm deeply ashamed of it all now, but it was over a decade ago. 

Maybe I reacted that way because he was my first love, and at my young age, 18 months seemed like a long time to have been together. I knew I was acting totally crazy and over the top, but I didn't care - I just wanted him back at any cost.

Make it a true pay-as-you go program. 

Payroll taxes are applied at a certain rate to anyone working.

Say we collect taxes through the entire year of 2012. The social security agency then announces, ""ok in 2012, we collected X billion. There are Y million people drawing benefits from social security. In 2013, each recipient will receive a check for x/(y*12) each month.

There. No more surpluses. No more deficits. Everyone is guaranteed to get *something*. 

Social security, from the beginning, has always been a welfare program for the old paid for by the young. Yet, most people don't see it as such. The government has worked very hard to mask what it is. They send out statements and show that what you will pull out in retirement is proportional to what you put in. They go to great lengths to make people think they're contributing to some sort of personalized retirement plan, rather than just paying into the welfare state. 

This is how you can have so many old people also be so opposed to welfare. They simply don't realize that they're on the dole. They think of it as just a retirement program like a pension or a 401k.

Screw that. Those statements are fictitious. There's not enough money available to pay everyone's promised claims. 

I say we stop arguing if the social security trust fund is real or not. If social security cashes in the bonds, the main part of the federal government will have to pay for it or borrow additional money to pay for it. Let's just quit pretending the trust fund exists. Admit it's fictitious and get on with our lives.

Going to a simple flat-rate, pay-as-you go system would make it clear to people exactly what arrangement they're living under. They're on welfare. They're living off of taxes imposed on others.

My grandmother died from rheumatoid arthritis. For the last ten years of her life, most movement was very painful for her. The last two years, she was on morphine, and it got to the point where she was bed-ridden, paranoid, and hallucinating.

The hallucination that let us know she was too far gone was when she was convinced that my grandfather had another trailer nearby, full of beautiful woman (my twelve-year-old sister among them) and a trapdoor under their bed that let him secret them in to their trailer. She tried to kill my grandfather with his revolver.

A year before she died, they had to start amputating limbs. She didn't recognize anybody anymore. My grandfather would sit by her bed, and weep. Then she would wake up, she would start raving at him, not recognizing her husband of fifty years. He had to hire a caretaker, who stole my grandmother's morphine. Towards the end, she was in the hospital. She'd lost both her legs, hands and arms too twisted to move, and was on a constant morphine drip. I was a pallbearer at the funeral. The thing I remember the most was my mother remarking how *light* my grandmother was. ""She's so small, there's hardly anything left.""And I agreed that the casket *was* light.

Let me break it down for you since you need it explained:

you, as a waiter get a set number of tables.. not a set number of people.

If you have a lot of tables with high occupancy.. IE: 4 at each table instead of 2 or 1, and then a group that wants you to push tables together along with other demands.. your work load suddenly doubled or tripled compared to what you do in a normal situation.

It is such a fantastic feeling busting your ass for two hours and then having a huge table get up and leave with no tip. You will be remembered, and even if that waiter does not serve you.. revenge will be the dish served up next time.

/R/BESTOF,['THIS_IS_RIGGED'],0,"Ok, story time:

So one day, I was sitting around, I was an early teenager. So it was pretty much a given that I was super horny. I began jacking off because, well, what else is there to do, am I right? Anyways, I was jerkin and workin, and I wanted to escalate my masturbatory experience- I wanted to fuck something. Unfortunately for my young, narcissistically promiscuous self, this is easier said than done. So I set out on a quest, introspective and extrospective, to find some object that is fuckable. I looked at loofahs and chairs and trash cans and trash, but nothing quite fit the size of my pubescent dick. Until I found the one: it was a calendar I had (several years out of date) that was bound with a metal spiral, like a notebook. The spiral seemed just the right size to fit my monument to horniness. So, instead of taking precautions like lubing up or getting all the way hard or thinking, I went gung-ho at it. As I said before, I was not quite all the way erect, and so as I was going at it, the tiny monster began to expand. As you can imagine, it started to get a little uncomfortable in a couple of ways, so I decided to give it a rest. Unfortunately, the little guy had swollen a bit, both from bonerocity and from some chafing from the metal rings. I had found that my dick had gotten stuck in the calendar.

So there I was, saving the date in a very special way, and nobody else was home. I couldn't pry my Excalibur from this stone to crown myself the king of stupid fucking ideas. I had to get somebody to help, though. I wasn't about to call 911, since I had heard that you got billed for that sort of stuff and I didn't want my mom finding out about this escapade. The only person nearby that I could think of was old man Nicholson, my neighbor. This guy had to be 70, at least. He had been in the war, and was short, stocky, and I'm pretty sure was made of calluses. For the huge extent that I did not want to go to him for help, I had to. So I went a-waddling over next door as discreetly as possible, with my pants most of the way on. I  rang the doorbell, and after an uncomfortable minute or so, he came to the door. At first he didn't notice the problem, but I said something like ""Mr. Nicholson, I need some help,"" and looked down at the problem that had arisen. He didn't even bat an eye. He took me inside, and using some pliers, we eventually got the rings apart enough for me to withdraw. He didn't ask any questions, but when I was walking out of the door, he looked me in the eye and said:

""Son, you just don't fuck calendars""

TL;DR: Don't fuck calendars.

"Former enlisted aircrewman here, currently going to the Dark Side, so I can answer this one.

In my experience, Officers are one of two types of individuals. You've got

* b) And then you have the quintessential college grad douchebag boy who for some reason has a superiority complex and complete hard-on for the fact that he is responsible for young American lives. This guy will refer to his Marines as ""retards who couldn't graduate college"" to his Officer buddies.

I have seen both shades of Marine Officer (pilots included) who were prior enlisted, and not, however, the majority of Marine Officers who were prior enlisted fall into group a).

It seems to me that the douchebag prior-enlisted Marine Officers forgot where they came from while away at college, or (most-likely) at TBS. No matter what though, there will always be a hierarchical difference between enlisted and officer.

"You are deluded. Either ""live a lie"" or admit what you're doing is wrong. The problem with people like you is that you've fallen for the liberal lie - that your ""personal journey of self discovery"" is more important than your financial stability and the good of society. Imagine what your grandparents/great grandparents would think, they had to live through the Depression - they knew their priorities. 

You think people have no responsibilities to thier fellow man? Individuals, and members of both genders have responsibilities to their community. I don't really know how to argue against someone as self obsessesd as yourself. ""Living your life according to [yourself]"" is the biggest liberal lie of all. You live according to your environment first and you must at least consider the good of your society.

I'm not a bigot, I'm not anti-gay or tranny. If it were up to me, the state would pay for or at least subsidise your procedure. What I'm against is people like you trying to rationalize your destructive choices and blame anyone but yourself. Attitudes like yours are the result of 40 years of liberal indoctrination.

Everyone has a right to complain about anything.  I'm sure you complain all the time, but you have that right because you're.... what?  A middle class, straight, cis, white male?  Hmmm...

&gt;You made the choice to do this when you decided it would be a neat idea to incur large medical bills with no way to pay them.

I don't have the bills, I need SRS(and other things) and don't have the money for it.  Also, I didn't choose to be trans.  I just chose not to live a lie.

&gt;Like it or not, you are all ambassadors for your ""gender"".

Sadly, this is true.  Though, I also think I will assume all males are transphobic assholes because *you* represent your entire gender.

&gt;You see nothing wrong with profiteering from destroying our society.

I'm destroying society? Awesome!  I guess I can check that off my 'to do' list.

&gt;You disregard the responsibilites of being a woman because you think your personal fufillment should take precedence over all else. You are selfish.

The responsibilities of being a woman?  As if you're qualified to stipulate what those are.(Are you serious?)  And we all seek our personal fulfillment.  All of us.  How is what I'm doing selfish?  Because it's not what YOU tell me I should be doing?  You're absolutely insane.

&gt;Becomming a female and then becomming a prostitute is like becomming an American citizen then blowing up the whitehouse and burning the Constitution.

Riiiiiight..

&gt;Now, you personally may believe you're only doing what you're doing out of desperation, but you need to think of people other than yourself for once.

For once?  It's funny.  I've heard of this a few times before.  Trans people being told they're ""selfish"" because they simply want to live their lives according to them.  Yet the people telling them that they're ""selfish"" don't seem to realize that they're trying to inflict *their* will upon others.  Fucking irony x10.

&gt;You're not a prostitute because you need to do it to survive, you do it because you want to do things that emphasise your femininity and you want to live live a lifestyle in which your gender is central. You chose your fate, but it's not too late to reform.

Taking the readily available personal information of a person and putting it online isn't illegal, but it's morally wrong! And my feelings about what's morally wrong outweigh the law!

**Big question: What are your views? Being ""conservative"" is too broad.**

Edit #1: Wow, thanks for all the upvotes! This is nuts!

Edit #2: I wrote my original post while on break at work and feel like there's more to talk about.

Republicans seem to be anti-regulation, anti-union. Granted, I understand that some unions get out of hand and negatively impact an industry. IMHO, the UAE would be a good example of this. But any local ""pro-business"" Republican seem to forget that anti-monopoly and safety regulations helped create the market we enjoy today. Progressives in the early 20th century held business accountable and kept the consumer/voter safe. It's easy now to take for granted what we have created, but it's even easier to lose it all. I understand that too many rules and regulations can choke a small business, but I get really anxious when potential leaders talk about slashing regulatory procedures. 

While some Democrats want more government programs, the Republicans are doing the opposite -- putting corporations in control of the country. I think we really need a good balance between government, business and citizens. The citizens vote for government to protect their interests. Some will say, ""Vote with your dollar!"" Now-a-days, with so many big corporations though, dollars don't go very far. Personally, I'll stay with my Constitutionally-given right to choose my representatives. If the Republican Party decides to keep government within its important role, I'll vote for them.",836,836,exile_from_digg,0,86

* Where are the two 4 ton engine impacts?
* Why is there no physical evidence for a airliner crash at this site?
* Why is the alleged pilot of this plane, not on the flight manifest and how did he avoid all CCTV at the airport, along with all the passengers?
* Why does the alleged Flight11's flight data recorder show that the airplane was too high to have even struck the lamp posts?
*  Why did they tamper with the only video they ever released, which does not show an aircraft, only a small explosion and why did the FBI confiscate all CCTV in the area, in a coordinated, almost pre-emptive swoop
* Why does the NTSB not plan to issue a report or open a public docket? The NTSB has issued a report for all planes that crash in the U.S, not for 9/11, Why?
* The physically impossible Barbara Olson phone calls

"&gt;Who are you (the general ""you"") to belittle us for spending our money on what we consider to be a worthwhile experience?

I'll belittle you for buying another Treyarch sequel and expecting anything different :p",['[deleted]'],0,"&gt; But BO will still follow the general COD plot.

How do you know that?  From what I've seen, the way the story is told is significantly different from past iterations, told partially through flashbacks and breaking up the timeline.  NV differed from Fallout 3 by introducing a more branching narrative, but this isn't always a good thing and it only fits certain types of games.  In my opinion, truly immersive and engrossing experiences need to be linear at least to some extent.  Black Ops uses a linear plot progression to allow them to create awesome, immersive set-pieces.  Some people don't get a thrill playing through these, but I do.

&gt; Uh the guns are all functionally similar but only differ in their stats.

That's what I'm saying.  Fallout guns are all point-and-shoot.  In Black Ops, you have rockets that you can control mid-air, exploding R/C cars, etc.  Based on my experience with the Fallout franchise, the guns in Black Ops seem to functionally differ to a greater extent than the guns in Fallout do.

&gt; it's still *less* glitchy than FO3.

Again, I've seen no evidence of this.  I've heard tons of stories about games crashing.  I had zero problems with FO3.  I encountered no bugs or crashes my entire time playing that game.  It's hard to objectively assert which is ""more buggy"" because I might pick up New Vegas tomorrow, and if I encounter one crash it will have been more buggy than FO3.

&gt; Black Ops is simply a slight upgrade to MW2.  I don't think very many people would deny that.

I guess I'm not very many people, then.  Because I definitely think that calling Black Ops a ""slight upgrade"" to MW2 is selling it short, considering the sheer amount of new content in the game.  New Vegas did things differently by letting you side with a faction rather than relying on a black and white karma system (though I think that still exists, no?), the basic play experience seems almost exactly the same.  I shouldn't make a statement like that, having been unable to play it yet, but changing the plot progression and adding some considerations for decision-making does not constitute a change to the core mechanics.  I'm not arguing that NV doesn't deserve to be released at full price, I'm arguing that Black Ops deserves a full-price release just as much.

And yes, what it comes down to is fun.  The whole reason I started this discussion is because the original commenter basically called the OP an idiot for buying the game, because he ""bought the same game two years in a row.""  This is really fucking irritating to me, because, like you said, it comes down to fun.  Both the OP and I plan to have fun with this game.

There is a process that can happen when you have kids.  You are attractive beforehand.  No matter what.  16 year old boys in groups will check you out even if you are chunky or kind of ugly.  THEY STILL LOOK.  After you have a baby, you become invisible.  Not that you ever wanted a 16 yo boy to look, but they did. whether its the phermones or the baby, you become invisible unless you look like you are probably the babysitter, not the mom.  

People who are your friends, acquaintances, neighbors, whatever no longer talk to you.  They admire the baby, say how cute, gush...  and never once ask you if you saw District 9 yet, or tell you about a great book they just read.  You become a piece of the baby.  Even your husband.  He loves you, he loves the baby.  Sometimes at first HE is very jealous of the baby because the baby owns your boobs, and your time, and you are sleep deprived and you ignore him.  

When he falls in love with his baby daughter it reverses.  He'll do anything to make her laugh, invest limitless planning and thought into making her happy...  and since you stopped caring about him 6 months ago, he forgets about you. He doesn't even realize he thinks of you as a parenting partner and not a wife.  And everyday the alarm goes off at 6 and you both run off, promising yourselves to fix it later. 

It is very hard to regain your identity after having a child.  You can go years being (variable)'s mom.  You lose your femininity,  your youth, your sexuality...your mind...

And no one warns you.  Not even your mom.  If you knew, you'd prepare.  You would see it happening and make sure you fucked your husband even if you didn't feel like it.  You'd hire a sitter to make time for dates.  You would not stand by while the emotional divide grew.

But it does, and then you struggle through... for years.  If your marriage survives, maybe you learn to love eachother again.  Maybe it's just too far gone.

I WOULD BET MY LEFT NUT YOU'RE FAT AS FATASS,['spartan1337'],0,"Well, my surgeon recommended removing almost 900 grams per breast, which is almost 2 pounds.  If you have some handweights laying around, grab about 4 pounds and pay down with those on your chest.  Feel how your breathing becomes constricted?  Yeah, that'll happen when your diaphragm can't fully expand.  Now picture that every time you lay down.  And side sleeping isn't better, since all that weight is pulling you to the side.  Uncomfortable doesn't really cover it.

Now realize that *natural* breasts don't defy gravity like implants.  The weight of natural breasts pulls them downward to rest against the chest wall.  Skin resting on skin.  And creating a nice sweaty, moist environment.  Hellooo yeast growth, and underboob sweat.  Sexy thought, ain't it?

Then on to bras.  Cute sexy bras simply do not come in industrial sizes.  Once you leave the realm of DDD, bras are expensive and hard to find, ugly, and purely functional.  No Victoria's Secret or La Pearla.  Now bras for the most at intended to be supportive from the *band*, not the straps.  At larger sizes, this just doesn't happen.  The straps have to do more of the work, and lovely groves develop in your shoulders.  Those tend to stay, even after you take off your bra.

On to back and neck pain.  If you still had those handweights, trying hanging them around your neck for a while.  Seriously, don't be a wimp and try for just a little bit.  Give it an hour or two.  I'll wait.

How's your neck feeling?  Sore?  And your back probably hurts.  I've been on painkillers for years, plus muscle relaxers for when the spasms get really bad.  And that's just basic standing or sitting  I'm a nurse, so I spend a great deal of time bending over patients.  Giving shots, changing dressings, all get significantly harder on your spine.

And don't get me started on clothes.  Getting clothes to fit and avoid looking like a stuffed sausage means going several sizes larger in shifts.  Large, billowy, shirts that swim all over you.  These are still better than clingy shirts, though.  Unless you think having conversations addressed to your breasts is a good thing.  
The difference that I think is important for people to understand is between [this person](http://i.imgur.com/IRKrh.jpg) who clearly wants attention, and people like me who do nothing to drawn unwanted attention except hit puberty.  Still, people (yes, women too) seem to find it perfectly acceptable to comment on my chest.  Or grab me.  I avoid clubs and bars because drunk people grope me.  The only time in my life that I every struck anyone was at a bar, when some fool kept ""bumping"" into me and mysteriously landing hands out. That was the only time I've ever slapped anyone in my life. 

Now, I apologize for the giant rant.  You can probably tell that this hits a nerve, and is not primarily directed at your comment.  However, you should never have to ""suppose"" again about how it feels.




Edit:  **Holy Orangered!*  Made this post before I went to sleep, just logged back on and I'm reddit famous.  Whee!  Because of my boobs...oh, right.

The history of my boobs.  I've had em since I was twelve.  They made my teenage years a nice slice of hell.  I never actually had the training bra stage that most adolescent girls go through.  I went straight into mom bras.   I wore a D cup bra by 7th grade and I LIVED in oversized shirts and anything that I thought would hide them.  (According to teenage boys of my experience, this doesn't work.)

They have continued to increase for years, regardless of my weight at the time.  Hell, when I'm skinny, they look bigger in proportion!  I lost a good amount of weight a few years ago by living at the gym.  Lost weight everywhere but my chest, and I had to go up a band size because I tightened up my chest wall.  Can't win.

Now, to those that I have convinced to lay around with dumbells on their chest...*snicker*...thanks, those made me giggle.  I should specify that the 4 pounds is what would be removed by reduction.  I would still be a damn D cup.  I honestly do not know how much each boob weighs.  Sorry.

I'm a survivor of sexual assault myself and work in my community and on campus as an advocate for survivors and their loved ones. One thing that I think a lot of people don't expect is that someone dealing with the aftermath of rape might not act in the way movies and TV tell us a victim will act-- crying and sobbing and fearfulness are all perfectly normal reactions to an assault, but it's also very common for a survivor to feel angry, calm, numb, or any other mixture of emotions. Some people don't want to have sex for a long time afterwards. For others, loving and safe sex is a great comfort to them. Everyone reacts to trauma differently. The important thing is to let her grieve and recover in her own way.

I'm glad that you're committed to being a good listener and, honestly, that's the best and biggest thing that you can be for her right now. She might not want to talk about it for a while, or ever. She might need to talk about it immediately. She might want someone to hold her hand as she talks to lawyers and police, or she might want to do it alone. Respect how much involvment she wants you to have and respond to her wishes, not necessarily how you think she ought to pursue it. 

Finally, you should take care of yourself. It's really hard to watch someone you love go through this and it's ok to feel overwhelmed by it. It can strain your relationships. It can inspire a lot of anger or sadness or frustration in you. Do you have friends or family members that you can vent to? Is it possible for you to investigate counselling as well?

It's supposed to happen that way otherwise we would have never made it this far as a species.

Being emotionally attached means being afraid of losing something and acting irrational.

In her case it wasn't just the sex, it was her fear of being used and tossed amplified by how common it is in society and perhaps past experiences in her life. So she had a itchy trigger finger on the crazy gun.

It will wear off eventually but everytime this happens it gets worse and it compounds into making her a neurotic mess. Her compounded desperation actually means she doesn't learn from her mistakes and out of irrational fear ""puts out"" easier/earlier in her relationships. In fact, you can see her recognize where she's completely fumbled it and then resign herself to ""the fact"" that she fucked it all up. Her lowered self image means instead of making proper judgments next time on who to  have sex with and when, she'll make brash decisions always assuming she's at fault and getting increasingly desperate for success. Even the slightest hint of success will send her into euphoric overdrive because she will have been waiting so long and the slightest hint of failure will result in her devolving into an inconsolable wreck because she'll see things through a lens which is biased against her. ""[overly analyzes random interaction] Oh, he isn't as happy as I am the next day? He must be a jerk. I probably deserved it. I'm hopeless.""

And she probably started off like a nice, normal girl.

The only reason it might not snowball into catastrophe so quickly is because there's just as many, if not more, desperate men who are similarly neurotic about the slightest and most subtle interactions in the early stages of meeting someone due to constant fumbling. Every once in a while she'll find a guy who she's got the edge over and it brings her back from the edge until one or the other's insecurity manifests and fucks it up again. She rebounds slightly better, he rebounds slightly worse. 

These people eventually somehow find a way to start a dysfunctional family whose kids fuck with other kids who had healthy family lives. They learn ill thought out views of society from their parents. Maybe she'll raise homophobic racists. Maybe she'll raise super hippie liberal junkies or violent anarchists. She will probably try her best but turn her insecurities on them making them react harshly towards her leading her to be abusive towards them which drives them into escape, literal escape followed by either descent into addiction (drugs, sex, whatever) or perhaps ascension and success albeit with a complete lack of trust in personal relations due to their fucked up family life.

In my opinion this gives the extremists more power. It allows them to approach the moderates and say ""look at how they view our religion."" Marginalising people pushes them further away from mainstream society and in this case, towards extremism. These cartoons are not defending free speech.

I prefer public figures who are as genuine as is possible (I realize the limits of celebrity, believe me).

By contrast, I am left cold and turned off by those who are so guarded that they refuse to reveal anything they believe in.  It makes it harder for me to be interested in them.

[Obama issued an executive order](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/22/us/politics/22gitmo.html) dictating Guantanamo to be closed as soon as he took office.  [Congress is the one who blocked this move](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/promise/177/close-the-guantanamo-bay-detention-center/), inserting language into the defense bill (both in the House and Senate) which specifically prohibits the use of funds to purchase or modify any U.S. facility for Gitmo prisoners.

&gt; Obama has extended the Patriot Act 

[Obama extended **three provisions** of the Patriot Act](http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/09/15/politics/main5314011.shtml), not the entire thing itself which you seem to imply.  Now, the merits of those provisions can be argued for or against, but don't try and pass on as fact that he extended the whole thing, implying the entire thing could have also been vetoed, it's just not true.  Furthermore, Obama has *never* said he thought the entire act was bad and should be removed.  He agrees with the fundamental principles of it, just believes it needs civil right protections.  He was never going to try and get the entire thing overturned.

&gt; Obama continues the failing and destructive war on drugs.

The executive branch is in charge of enforcing the laws, not creating them. It is the legislative branches job to stop the war on drugs by repealing the Controlled Substance Act.  You can criticize Obama for not being harsher with the DEA for ignoring Obama and Holder and still going after large medical marijuana distributors, but to lay the entire ""continuation of the war on drugs"" at Obama's feet is just ridiculous.  Besides, [Obama has never really been for legalization](http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2007/11/25/4423993-obama-open-to-limited-legalization).

&gt; We are still at war despite our spiraling debt

Which Obama continually campaigned on expanding.

&gt; Neither Obama nor the rest of the democrats have made any effort to significantly address gay marriage

[Besides the fact that Obama has never supported same-sex marriage](http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/issues/issues.samesexmarriage.html), it's not up to him (or even Congress) to decide.  It will most likely need to come down to a Supreme Court decision overruling it based on the 14th amendment.  The most Congress could do would repeal DOMA, and please tell me where you get the 60 votes in the Senate to do this.  Between Joe Lieberman, Ben Nelson and Max Baucus, you're not going to get much to the left of right of center passed.

There is a *lot* more to the health care bill than just pharma.

Again, anything you wished to see in the bill, ask yourself if you could get the big 3 (mentioned above) to vote for it.  Joe Lieberman alone was adamant at no public option, and without his vote it doesn't get through the Senate.  And please note that every single time a health care reform initiative has failed, it takes about 15 years for the issue to be brought up again, and every single time the proposals get less and less progressive.

&gt; with such a flawed stimulus that former Senator Feingold voted against it

[Feingold voted for ARRA](http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00064).

&gt;  Much of this was (and still is) well within his power to affect--if not change outright.

Actually, no.  Everything you mentioned either (a) takes Congress and 60 votes in the Senate to do or (b) Obama campaigned upon.  Furthermore, from this point out he will have a Republican Congress and 52-53 votes in the Senate, so he has even less sway with what happens over the next 2 years.  

Obama campaigned as left of center on economic issues, right of center on social issues, and pretty moderately right on foreign ones, and that's pretty much what we've gotten.  As the saying goes, a chain is only as strong as it's weakest link, Congress is only as liberal as the 60th Senate vote.  Yes, there is plenty to be disappointed about and criticize over the past couple years, and you and others should continue to do so.  But to put the majority of the blame at Obama's (or any presidents) feet is absurd.",['johnnyg113'],0,"&gt;If anything, many of these disgruntled citizens lambasting the president for what they perceive to be a succession of concessions to the Republicans don't know how it is.

lol really? Did Obama tell you that?

Guantanamo Bay is still open and running. Obama has extended the Patriot Act and expanded invasive spying on our own citizens. Obama continues the failing and destructive war on drugs. The already bloated defense budget continues to grow. We are still at war despite our spiraling debt and Wikileaks's bloody revelations, and, in fact, Obama has condemned Wikileaks as dangerous even though he ran on a platform of accountability. He ordered the assassination of a US citizen without due process. He ordered the cluster bombing of a site in Yemen that resulted in the death of 30+ women and children (and we're still surprised when they send bombs back!). Neither Obama nor the rest of the democrats have made any effort to significantly address gay marriage or the myriad of other social issues. When public interest in his party drops, he criticizes the populace instead of his own middle-right pandering. Now he also supports the rather invasive TSA violation of our 4th amendment right in the nebulous name of ""terror.""

He passed a health care bill that did not affect the toxic framework of the corporate pharmaceutical profits system. He has paid off the big banks for their failures and the CEOs continue to make record profits with little new accountability (with such a flawed stimulus that former Senator Feingold voted against it). He did help draw the economy out of a recession, but I'm not convinced that another person could not have done the exact same thing--if not better--under similar conditions.

Admittedly, Obama has enacted some small changes, a lot of which are quite beneficial. However, he continues to erode our civil liberties and push an imperialist agenda. Much of this was (and still is) well within his power to affect--if not change outright. Yet here we are, still living underneath so many Bush-like policies that would've been outrageous to liberals were Republicans still in power.

i should just stop but i'm home now and i want to get this off my chest.  by the way, aren't you supposed to be in until 4:30 today?  why are you on reddit and not working?

all my life people made fun of me.  the nicknames started in middle school and continued until high school such ugly troll, fat shit, ogre, lots of troll references.  i used to cry myself to sleep at night.  literally as in i literally cried myself to sleep, not literally like in you saying vapid things like that was literally the worst thing ever after the quarterly townhall meeting.  i don't think you're using it right.  high school was even worse when the acne kicked in.  college was basically four years of being alone contemplating suicide.

but you know what?  i don't give a shit anymore.  you may be 6'1' charming in-shape with nice skin, but i have something you will never have.  i am deep down a nice guy.  even after being beaten down more than your shallow ass could ever handle, i still try to smile and see the good in people.  i still genuinely care about people's lives.  i still go out of my way to make the world a brighter place for everyone, not just myself.  you don't care about people.  i noticed when you let the door slam on that lady walking out yesterday.  i also notice how you blatantly poured yourself a giant cup of the free coffee this morning knowing full well you'd finish it and several others including me wouldn't get to have any.  but i looked past those and thought we could still be friends because i try to see the good in people.  maybe i was just excited that i finally thought i made a friend.  who knows.

well fuck yourself.  you win this round.  i'm going to stop talking to you and bothering you.  i won't ask you to go places.  i won't reference workaholics and archer anymore.  i won't buy you lunch to be nice.  i won't even acknowledge you unless it's for a work reason.  you are smarter, more handsome, more liked by the boss, have more friends, are better at everything than me.  but i win in the end.  i have a good heart.  what's the point of having all those things if you have no soul?  you clearly don't.

i'm considering just deleting this but fuck it.  i know i'm ugly.  i know no one likes me.  i have no friends.  kick me when i'm down.  but the next time, think twice before you blatantly dismiss someone for being ugly or different.  maybe deep down it was just a sad lonely guy who just finally wanted to make a friend...................

IF ANYTHING, I'D STATE THAT THE BIGGEST PROBLEM THE AH HAS IS THAT IT MAKES IT CLEAR HOW MUCH YOUR GEAR SUCKS AND SIMPLE MATH PUTS A NUMBER OF HOURS ON HOW MUCH TIME IT WOULD TAKE YOU TO BUY BETTER GEAR.

I AGREE THAT THEY MISSED WHAT MADE THE GAME FUN, BUT I THINK WHAT THEY MISSED IS THAT IN D2 YOU DON'T *NEED* THAT GEAR TO GET ALL THE WAY THROUGH HELL AND EFFECTIVELY MF.

D2 IS A MATTER OF KNOWLEDGE + BUILD + EFFICIENCY, D3 IS A FAT GEAR CHECK GRIND.  I CAN TAKE A SORC IN D2 AND GO GRIND HIGH LEVEL AREAS IN RATHER BASIC GEAR THAT CAN BE FOUND WITH A COUPLE WEEKS OF MFING IN *NIGHTMARE*.  D3 DOESN'T WORK IN THIS WAY AT ALL.

D2 WAS ABOUT JUMPING INTO AN 8 PLAYER GAME AND JUST TEARING IT UP, SHOWING OFF HOW AWESOME YOUR GEAR WAS.  THAT WAS THE INCENTIVE TO GET GEAR FAR BETTER THAN YOU ACTUALLY NEEDED TO MF.  IN THIS WAY THEY SEPARATED THE DIFFICULTY OF THE GAME (PROGRESSION, GROUPING) FROM MF WHICH WAS DONE SOLO.

YOU WON'T MF ACT 3 IN HELL IN D3 FOR GEAR THAT IS VIABLE ALL THE WAY UP TO ACT 4 INFERNO WITH THE ""RIGHT BUILD"".  ITS PRETTY CLEAR THAT THEY ARE GOING TO NERF THE SHIT OUT OF ANY BUILD THAT BREAKS THE DIFFICULTY CURVE OF THE GAME.

SPEAKING OF BREAKING THE DIFFICULTY CURVE, D3 IS BASED ON THE ""ITEM BUDGET"" MENTALITY, AND ITS PRETTY RARE TO EQUIP ANYTHING LESS THAN A LEVEL 60 ITEM AT LEVEL 60.  SURE THEY DID A GREAT JOB BALANCING THINGS ON THAT FRONT FOR THE MOST PART.  IN FACT, THEY DID ALMOST TOO GOOD A JOB.  PART OF THE FUN OF D2 WAS THAT YOU COULD FIND ""END GAME"" ITEMS VERY EARLY ON.

You click on monsters to make them explode with loot, then you get the loot.

Problem is a lot of people bought a piñata, bought the candy, and then realized they don't need the piñata anymore.  If the auction house hadn't caught on, the piñata would still be fun, or if something was still even mildly obtainable without real funds.  But the simple fact of the matter is that they've given the community a way to entirely bypass the game, and then made the bypassing actually necessary to succeed past a certain level.

MMO market logic doesn't transfer to a Single-player/co-op multiplayer game.  Blizzard's killed what was once their flagship franchise by completely missing the point of what made the game fun.  The goal was better gear, yes, but now it's a goal without meaning, and one that we don't even need the game to succeed at.

I'm not saying what she did was morally wrong, or even unethical.  I'm saying it was a dick move.

I am saying you don't take an honest disagreement made on a blog post, take that disagreement and out of context (did the audience even know what was going on?  Did they have the back-story?), conflate it with something vile (threats of rape, murder, etc..), in front of an audience who probably is already on your side (a power imbalance) during a presentation that is completely off-topic and publicly call someone out in that manner.

Could she have replied right then and there?  Sure, I guess.  She could have gone up after the speech and used the Q&amp;A session to address it.  Would I have?  Absolutely.  In fact, they would be dragging me out of the place because shit would have gone down.  But I also recognize that everyone else isn't me.

If you claim to be a professional, you just do not fucking do that.  Not ever.

It would have been different if Steph and Watson were on a panel together talking about sexism and how it related to the skeptic movement.  Fine.  Acceptable.

The Keynote Speech was about ""The Religious Right's War on Women"".  Steph was in the audience.  Watson was the Keynote speaker.  Steph had an honest disagreement with something Watson said on an unrelated manner on her blog.  Steph addressed it on her own blog.  Watson called her out in public over it (after just putting up, on screen all the rape and murder comments she got on Youtube) under the circumstances listed above.

Can you imagine having your name and blog flashed up on the screen after all that, in an audience that's already been won over to your side over something completely unrelated?  Then being told that because you disagree, you are falling for 'ancient anti-woman' rhetoric?

Not cool.  Not professional.

"Or you can see it if you read the interview his Homeland Security chief gave to der spiegel when they came into office...

http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/interview-with-homeland-security-secretary-janet-napolitano-away-from-the-politics-of-fear-a-613330.html

&gt;Janet Napolitano, 51, is President Obama's new Homeland Security Secretary. She spoke with SPIEGEL about immigration, the continued threat of terrorism and the changing tone in Washington.

&gt;SPIEGEL: Madame Secretary, in your first testimony to the US Congress as Homeland Security Secretary you never mentioned the word ""terrorism."" Does Islamist terrorism suddenly no longer pose a threat to your country?

&gt;Napolitano: Of course it does. I presume there is always a threat from terrorism. **In my speech, although I did not use the word ""terrorism,"" I referred to ""man-caused"" disasters. That is perhaps only a nuance, but it demonstrates that we want to move away from the politics of fear toward a policy of being prepared for all risks that can occur.**

Or you can pretend that Nepalitano just made this up and Obama has no control over what his homeland security chief says or claims and she is just full of shit, I guess. Seems to be the way the others in this thread are going to do it...

Everyone understands how absurd this policy was... It's why the administration abandoned it and makes sure to throw the word ""Terrorism"" in general admonishing terms in many speeches... But for you to willingly ignore and deny the reality of the situation is a little absurd.

It's like pretending their slogan for 2012 wasn't ""**W**inning **T**he **F**uture [before they realized the flaw in their cunning plan and changed it to ""Forward!"".](http://www.nmu.edu/obama/obama020.jpg)

&gt;Perhaps because they can be so insufferable, teenage boys are often marked down. The OECD found that boys did much better in its anonymised tests than in teacher assessments. The gap with girls in reading was a third smaller, and the gap in maths—where boys were already ahead—opened up further. In another finding that suggests a lack of even-handedness among teachers, boys are more likely than girls to be forced to repeat a year, even when they are of equal ability.

&gt;What is behind this discrimination? One possibility is that teachers mark up students who are polite, eager and stay out of fights, all attributes that are more common among girls. In some countries, academic points can even be docked for bad behaviour. Another is that women, who make up eight out of ten primary-school teachers and nearly seven in ten lower-secondary teachers, favour their own sex, just as male bosses have been shown to favour male underlings.

&gt; And I'll just brace myself for the downvotes now.

I was just gonna tell you to get out, but this sentiment really rubbed me the wrong way, so you know what I'm gonna tell you?

Screw you, you god damn coward.

This sentiment isn't original or unique, we get redditors a dime a dozen coming in here to make this 'I BELIEVE IN FREE SPEECH, BRACE FOR THE DOWNVOTES' sentiment all the time. They put themselves up on such a pedestal, and act like they are some martyr for free speech. That they are truly taking the hard stance and defending something that is under assault.

Well I got news for all these shitlords trying to position themselves this way. You aren't some courageous hero defending free speech from the onslaught of totalitarian hordes. You're just a bunch of cowards, who when faced with the ugly realities of life and the hard questions on how to deal with them decided that it was much easier to ignore the problems rather than face them.

Because it's so much easier to just ignore the problem. It's so much easier to just dismiss horrible incidents like these as 'well its just the internet' or 'well it sucks that it happened, but free speech'. That way you don't ever actually have to think about the harder questions like 'Can what we say harm other people?' and 'How can we work together to stop these incidents from happening?'. Questions that don't have simple answers, questions that require a lot of different perspectives to get meaningful answers, and question that sometimes upset us when we do find answers. Instead you would much rather take the intellectual shortcut of 'EITHER ALL SPEECH IS OK OR NONE OF IT IS', the kind of binary attitude that doesn't work in the real word.

So don't try and position yourself like your making some heroic sacrifice. You're not. You're just another in a long line of people who decided it was easier to ignore problems rather than deal with them.

But Canadians don't want EVERYTHING American. Being Canadian entitles us to pick and choose. we don't have to invest in a real military because we know the U.S. (out of self-interest, not because they're nice guys) will always protect us. So Canada engaged in a lot of 'social loafing' in the Cold War. This also allows Canada to concentrate on 'peace keeping' since its the one use of the military that feminists and socialists will agree to. And Canadians want socialized medicine because its cheaper. And if you have a real urgent health problem and you don't want to wait 5 months for surgery in Canada you just mortgage your house and get it done in the U.S. Best of both worlds!!! Thanks America!! Oh, yeah, and gun control.
Of course gun control doesn't make Canada unique in the world. Only different from the U.S. But that's all most Canadian nationalists care about; Pretending we're different from Americans.

That's the difference between Anglo-Canada and the U.S. states north of the Mason-Dixon line: small, ineffective military, socialized medicine and gun control. And if the U.S. north of the Mason-Dixon line had things their way they'd have things just the way Canada does. So when it comes to differences between Canadians and Americans of the northern states the differences are pretty hard to find.

"Best bets so far are to use a combination of parachutes and retrograde rockets like how they landed the Curiosity Rover. Of course, that landing was nick-named the '7 minutes of terror'... so good luck trying that out with human cargo.",['cyrusm'],0,"They were just talking about them this morning on NPR. He was talking about the first step being to land a rover on Mars. The interviewer was like, ""and where is the hundreds of millions of dollars coming from for that?"" He said, ""we're talking to donors...""

NPR then spoke with other experts from NASA and other places. The consensus seems to be that Elon Musk's Space X will get there first. 

I was surprised to hear that the one of the biggest challenges to going to Mars is figuring out how to land that much mass safely. Never really thought about it, but the thin atmosphere does rule out parachutes. The fuel needed to burn thrusters to slow down might be prohibitively expensive to carry. We surrounded the rover's in airbags and just crash landed those. I don't think that would work for something of the mass of crew and habitats. ",238,238,cybermage,0,182

"AS A PERSON WITH COLOR DISABILITIES THAT LEAVE PIE CHARTS NIGH UNREADABLE, THANK YOU!",['alomomola'],0,"**I noticed it is difficult to make any sense of these results from the graphs provided, so here is a brief analysis of the results.**

Overall, as you can see, there is little differentiation in the data. The overall trend, however, is that those who rate themselves as less attractive and those with smaller cup sizes tend to be less flattered and more annoyed at boobie-oglers, although not by much. 24.1% of women with A or B-sized breasts reported feeling annoyed, whereas this number fell to 21.5% for C or C-sized breasts and only 20.4% for those with DD or larger – the smallest percentage of them all. Similarly, women who rated themselves least attractive were more likely to be annoyed by breast-staring: 22.7% of 1-3’s reported annoyance, compared to 22.3% for self-reported 4-7s and an even lower 20.4% of 8-10s.

Similarly, the percentage of women reporting a ‘gross’ reaction to oglers fell as both attractiveness and breast size increased: for the attractiveness rating, this fell from 15.% (1-3) to 9% (4-7) and 7.8% (8-10); for breast size, this fell from 10.1% (A and B) to 8.9% (C and D) to 7.3% (DD+). We can see the same results for the response “flattered if he’s hot,” with most respondents selecting this option being self-reportedly attractive. Interestingly, although the same pattern can be seen for attractiveness (i.e. a positive correlation between level of attractiveness and likelihood to be flattered if the man in question is hot), this is not the case for breast size, where 18.6% of A and B-sized women are flattered if he is hot, but only 12% of DD+ are.

Moreover, the overall response ‘flattered’ does not conform to this trend with regards to attractiveness: the self-rated 1-3s and 8-10s are most likely of all to choose this answer, whereas the 4-7s are overall least likely (22.7, 22.3, and 18.6%, respectively). With regards to breast size, however, this response conforms to the trend: large-breasted women are more likely to be flattered.

So who is more likely to not care? Well, the less attractive you are, the less you care. In fact, the most attractive women are the most likely to care. However, breast size here has little to no impact on choosing this answer. Similarly, breast size has no impact on whether women feel flattered if the man makes an effort not to look at the boobies in question. Again, however, more attractive women were more prone to choose this answer. 

There were no clear trends in the ‘flattered as long as he doesn’t take too long category,’ although this was the most popular response. Those most likely to choose this response were cup sizes C and D and those who rate themselves 4-7. Other breast sizes and levels of attractiveness were all below average.


Overall, women tend to be flattered as long as the man is respectful about it – if he doesn’t take too long (41.1%) or if he tries not to (28.7%). However, almost a quarter of all respondents claimed to be annoyed at this behavior. Keep that in mind, boys.

The data is difficult to assess, but these are my tentative conclusions:

* Women do not mind ogling so much as long as men make a clear effort to not stare too long or if they are trying not to stare

* The more attractive women are, the more flattered and less grossed out they will be – I might put forth a tentative hypothesis that this may be linked to self-confidence in some way, since these are self-reported attractiveness ratings, after all

* The bigger the breasts, the less likely the woman will be grossed out or annoyed, and the more likely to be flattered

* It is very clear that not many women are grossed out by this behavior, although quite a few are annoyed

* There seems to be an understanding from women respondents that men will stare at breasts, and this is understandable behavior as long as it is done subtly, respectfully, and I would assume as long as it does not detract from a conversation (from the relative abundance of ‘annoyed’ responses).

Please note that the sample is likely skewed due to self-selection and that fact that many respondents are likely men. Also, I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.

EL5,['ButtonSmashing'],0,"First of all, let me start off by saying that the nuance is extremely subtle, so in order for me to explain it, I'm going to have to exaggerate the meaning a little bit. 

Traditionally Korean women prefer men who are a couple years older (This is not necessarily true anymore.) Therefore any decent man who is older is considered a potential mate, whereas women generally considered younger guys just as a kid and not a real man. “Oppa” is also a very friendly term used between close people. Rather than using “시” which is the equivalent of “Mr.”, Psy introduces himself as “oppa” right away so that he can pretend to be closer to the girl than he actually is.
 
**Basically by calling himself oppa, Psy is saying that the girl should look at him as a potential mate. He’s subtly hitting on her.** 

In addition, there is a sort of an age hierarchy because oppa means that Psy is older. The hierarchy in combination with his claim of being of a wealthy Gangnam Style implies, **""Hey there little girl, let this big, strong man take care of you.""** This fits in really well with the rest of the song because the ""Oppa"" character in the song is a poser who tries to act all Gangnam (rich, well-educated.)

Therefore considering all of that together, **the phrase “Oppan Gangnam Style” criticizes women for being golddiggers** who only like rich guys so they can buy them luxury bags and overpriced coffee.
 
On the other hand, **it’s also making fun of Korean men who think they can get women simply by flashing and pretending that they have a lot of wealth.**

I realize that that’s a lot of innuendo from just a three word phrase, but “Oppan Gangnam Style” really does imply all of that. Hence the genius of this song. Other phrases in the song also imply just as much, particularly the ones about coffee, but they are extremely difficult to explain to someone who is unaware of Korean culture…and I don't think I'm articulate enough to explain….sorry. :)

If you do share the money they will be angry and resentful because they feel like they should have gotten more of it.

 I WORE IT TO SCHOOL, AND LONG STORY SHORT, THE KIDS WEREN'T IMPRESSED.

"**FIRST, I FEEL VIOLATED BY THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE SOMEONE KEEP TABS ON ME HERE.  IT'S CREEPY.**

NOW, HOW ABOUT THE FACT THAT YOUR MOTHER AND SISTER WERE VERY RUDE TO ME, AND MADE ME CRY?  ALL I DID WAS POLITELY SAY HELLO TO THEM AND ASK HOW YOU WERE, AND THEY PHYSICALLY TURNED AWAY AND IGNORED ME.  THAT HURT.  WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN US WAS NONE OF THEIR BUSINESS, AND I AM DISAPPOINTED THAT THEY DID NOT HAVE THE MANNERS TO BEHAVE DECENTLY.  I AM SORRY THAT I ACTED CHILDISHLY AND CALLED YOUR MOTHER NAMES.  IT WAS IMMATURE, AND I APOLOGIZE.  IT WAS SAID IN ANGER.  I'M NOT WAITING FOR AN APOLOGY FROM THEM; I'D BE WAITING A VERY LONG TIME.  

ALSO, WHAT DIRTY PICTURES HAVE I SENT YOU?  I AM NOT IN THE HABIT OF DOING THAT, SO I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED.  

FURTHERMORE, I HAVE NOT INITIATED CONTACT WITH YOU, AND FRANKLY, HAVE MADE IT DIFFICULT FOR MYSELF TO DO SO.  I UNFRIENDED YOU ON FACEBOOK, AND YOUR NUMBER HAS BEEN DELETED FROM MY PHONE FOR WEEKS.  YOU ARE THE ONE MESSAGING ME.  DELETE MY NUMBER. 

IN AN ENTIRE MONTH, I ""TWEETED"" ONE SNIDE COMMENT, BECAUSE I FOUND IT IRONIC THAT YOU ARE NOW DATING THE GIRL THAT YOU'D FORMERLY REFERRED TO AS ""SLUTTON.""  BY THE WAY, I AM AWARE THAT YOU TOLD YOUR FRIENDS THAT IF I HADN'T BEEN AT THAT WEDDING, YOU WOULD HAVE FUCKED HER.  NOW I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU WERE SO PARANOID ABOUT ME CHEATING ON YOU.  *NOTHING LIKE GUILT TO TURN YOU INTO A JEALOUS ASSHOLE.*

HONESTLY, I THINK THAT THAT ""SCREAMING"" WAS A LONG TIME COMING.  YOU WERE CONSISTENTLY RUDE TO ME AND TO MY FRIENDS, AND GOING OUT WITH YOU WAS UNCOMFORTABLE.  YOU COMPENSATED FOR YOUR ""SHYNESS"" BY ACTING LIKE A JERK, AND I FELT AWKWARD JUSTIFYING YOUR BEHAVIOR TO PEOPLE.  I WAS SIMPLY NOT INTERESTED IN DATING A DANE COOK WANNA-BE.  YOU KNOW ME WELL, AND YOU KNOW THAT I AM NOT ONE TO FUSS AT A SIGNIFICANT OTHER FOR EVERY LITTLE THING.  I NEVER LET MYSELF BE MAD AT YOU, EVEN WHEN I WAS ENTITLED TO BE ANGRY.  YOU KNOW THAT I WAS SWEET TO YOU.  A QUARTER OF YOUR WARDROBE CAME OUT OF MY POCKET.  I AM A GIVER, AND IT MADE ME HAPPY TO MAKE YOU HAPPY.  LOOKING BACK, I DID MUCH MORE FOR YOU THAN YOU EVER DID FOR ME.  THIS LEADS ME TO MY NEXT POINT.  APPARENTLY I MADE A POST A FEW WEEKS AGO ABOUT BEING UNSATISFIED.  WELL, FIRST, I DON'T REMEMBER DOING SO, AND SECOND, *EXACTLY HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN STALKING ME ON HERE?*  IF SUCH A POST EXISTED, IT WAS MORE THAN LIKELY ABOUT YOU.

*ADDITION: BY THE WAY, TELLING MY BEST FRIEND THAT YOU WANT TO MOTORBOAT HER WAS REALLY FUCKED UP.  IT WASN'T FUNNY, AND IT MADE HER FEEL VERY UNCOMFORTABLE.

AS FOR THE ANONYMITY OF REDDIT, I THINK YOU SHOULD BE THANKFUL THAT I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT THIS TO PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY KNOW YOU.  ALSO, I'D ASSUMED YOU WERE FINE UNTIL HALEY MENTIONED YOU CRYING ABOUT ME ON THE PHONE WITH HER.  THAT'S WHERE ""DEVASTATED"" CAME FROM.  AND MY TEARS?  I HATED THAT I HAD TO HURT YOU LIKE THAT.  BUT I THINK IT WAS BETTER FOR ME TO CUT TIES WITH YOU BEFORE I REALLY STARTED BECOMING INTERESTED IN ANOTHER GUY.  THAT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN FAIR TO YOU, AND I RESPECTED YOU TOO MUCH TO HAVE STRUNG YOU ALONG LIKE THAT.  

LISTEN, I HAVE MOVED ON.  I AM DATING SOMEONE ELSE NOW, AND I AM HAPPY.  I WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY, AND IF THIS GIRL MAKES YOU HAPPY, THEN ALL THE BETTER FOR YOU.  I AM GLAD THAT SHE WAS AT THE READY TO BE THERE FOR YOU.  HOPEFULLY SHE WILL BE ENOUGH TO VALIDATE YOU, SINCE I MUST NOT HAVE BEEN. **THAT SAID, I AM NOT INTERESTED IN BEING YOUR FRIEND, AND I DON'T EVEN WANT TO TALK TO YOU AGAIN.  YOU ARE MAKING THIS HARD FOR ME.  PLEASE STOP MESSAGING ME. **",['dishie'],0,"I was sent to Reddit by a mutual friend who happened to see Dishie's post.

This is her ex. Shall I tell my side of it?

Okay. I was not upset. I saw it coming. Really. Texted my good friend about it a few days prior. Went over to her house after work, where she broke up with me while crying on the couch (which was probably fake, if she was really over me for as long as she says she was). After she said her piece, I got up, calmly walked around the apartment getting all of my stuff she had, and left. ""Devastated"" and ""Fucking annihilated"" I was not. Disappointed and let down? Sure. I texted her BFF to come over and give her some emotional support, because I thought at the time she was seriously upset.

I went home, sat down, and realized that it wasn't the end of the world to lose Dishie. Things had been rough for a while, culminating in a big fight a few days before the break-up where she screamed at me in the parking lot of a bar before making up and getting over it, or so I thought. She admitted to me later that what she was trying to do was act as if everything was normal and happy so that maybe we'd really be happy again. I understand that justification, but if that is true or not, I don't know. I wasn't really happy with the relationship anymore, and made myself realize that I hadn't been for a few weeks now. I went out that night with some friends, had some fun, and put it all behind me.

I will admit, the only time I had any real issue with the whole thing is when I found out (again, through a mutual friend that is on Reddit) that she had posted here about ""her boyfriend"" a few weeks later (a post that is now since deleted, and ironically was about how she didn't feel appreciated by him), and I realized that she really was dating that guy she admitted to having feelings for the day she broke up with me. I was hurt, because knowing that someone you cared about has left you for someone ""better"" is emasculating, and I Facebook messaged her asking about it. Yeah, it was dumb, and it did nothing to make me feel better. Would I go back in time if I could and stop myself from doing it? Yeah, I would.

After a week or two, I started going on a few dates here and there. Nothing really serious, just lunch and the like. I got a Facebook message from the aforementioned bridesmaid, letting me know she heard about what happened and she was sorry, yadda yadda. I responded, we started a conversation over IM, and it's not stopped yet.

I'd like to point out that I took special pains to not be rude, disrespectful, or insulting towards Dishie. She insulted my mother after the break-up multiple times (my favorite one is that my mother is a ""bitch"" that ""looks like Skeletor""), she's called me a ""d-bag"" (as referenced above) and a ""psycho"", and all that jazz. I actually found some dirty pictures she sent me, and while I understand there's entire websites devoted to spreading ex-girlfriend pictures, I chose to forgo that route and deleted them instead. I also asked my friends after the breakup to not talk bad about her either, because I was already in the process of moving on and if we sit and talk about her the entire time, it just gives her that much more power and influence over me. I hate that she's ranting to anonymous strangers on the internet about me, but I'm tired of being the better person and letting her slander me without at least getting my side out.

As far as Dishie's assertion that I'm just dating this new girl to make her jealous, that's entirely untrue. After spending a few weeks talking to this girl, we realized we have a lot in common, and I truly cherish and enjoy her company. It's a long-distance relationship right now (4-hour time difference), which I'm pretty sure isn't the most effective way to make someone else jealous (""Hey look, I get to spend two weeks doing nothing but talking on the phone to that girl you don't like!"").

Since the earlier referenced Facebook message, I've lived my life sans-Dishie. Most of the stuff that's happened has been initiated by her. I've moved on, and I haven't really cared about what she's done or who she's been with until she started tweeting about the girl I'm with now. Nobody else (my mother, my girlfriend, my friends) deserve to be involved in this, and I feel bad that she's dragging all of them into it. Some friends have stated that it feels like she's trying harder and harder as time goes on to upset/hurt/anger me, since she didn't get the ""annihilated"" reaction she expected (and claims she did) when she broke up with me. Is that true? I don't know, but it feels like it. I just wish she'd let it go, leave me alone, and move on.

TL;DR: I wasn't as hurt as she thought/hoped; I've moved on and I wish she would do the same.

And no matter how you try to dress it up, if you announce publicly that homosexuality is a sin, you are hurting vulnerable people.

But even worse than that, you are saying something that makes no logical sense. Consider these points:

1. Jesus never mentioned homosexuality

2. The 10 commandments don't mention it.

3. Homosexuality is not against the law.

4. No one gets to choose their sexuality. I happen to be heterosexual but there is no way I had any choice in the matter, any more than I had any choice in the fact that I am left handed. Furthermore, very few people can change their sexuality and attempts to do so often result in tragic consequences. Most of us are stuck with whatever sexuality we have be it heterosexual, homosexual or bisexual.

5. Homosexuality relationships do not hurt anyone, any more than heterosexual relationships do.

6. Gay people, especially younger gay people, suffer enormously because of the hurtful and thoughtless things we Christians say about them. They get bullied, they end up committing self harm and even committing suicide. As a loving Christian I refuse to be a persecuter of anyone, let alone people from a vulnerable minority group.

7. To say gay people are sinning is to do something incredibly unfair, which decency, common sense and logic do not support.

I hope that answers your question. May God be with you as you reflect on these points.

EDIT: I wasn't paying enough attention. The comments about shifting down distracted me.",['arjie'],0,"Actually, without trying to sound like an ad here, learning active defensive driving from Young Drivers of Canada (or similar orgs) would help in these scenarios.

The theory goes like this, they make you practice on maneuvers in cases of near crash or use emergency brakes / put the car in neutral in case the acceleration is stuck (not a technical fault but maybe heels or carpet is pushing against the gas pedal), and you practice them a few times so that your brain has learned it. In moments of dangers, your brain is supposed to pick the best possible option from its knowledge base, reacting instinctively instead of thinking. By having prior knowledge with lessons in defensive driving, the brain may decide to use one of these possible actions.

One of the defensive driving the YDOC make you do is: slow down, blind spot check, swerve to another lane, and stop in quick succession and within short distance to minimize speed. The purpose is to reduce the force of collision or possible escape. Once the brain learns it, it actually becomes part of its repertoire to perform in cases of emergencies, which might be good and bad (ie trying to avoid an incoming car quickly while the cliff is on the side you are swerving to.)

That's why SWAT teams and Delta practice / simulate as much as they can with the information they have before they do a raid. It is to learn the place and have reactions planned and ready, minimizing brain thinking and learning time.

"Interesting story about that: His testimony of her phone call from the plane is the *only* testimony that includes ""box cutters"". All the other calls only mentioned knives. (edit: correction below)

Also, he has flip-flopped a lot on specifics. He first told CNN that his wife had “called him twice on a cell phone.” But he contradicted this claim on September 14, telling Hannity and Colmes that she had reached him by calling the Department of Justice collect. Therefore, she must have been using the “airplane phone,” he surmised, because “she somehow didn’t have access to her credit cards.” However, this version of Olson’s story, besides contradicting his first version, was even self-contradictory, because a credit card is needed to activate a passenger-seat phone.

Later that same day, Olson told Larry King Live that the second call from his wife suddenly went dead because “the signals from cell phones coming from airplanes don’t work that well.” After that return to his first version, he finally settled on the second version, saying that his wife had called collect and hence must have used “the phone in the passengers’ seats” because she did not have her purse.

(BTW you need a cell station in the plane for cell phones to work from any kind of high altitude, something that Flight 77 certainly did not have - her plane didn't go below 5,000ft until less than a few minutes before it crashed, which is *not* when she called)

So he settled on seat back phones. That's interesting, because according to an American Airlines representative:

&gt;we do not have phones on our Boeing 757. The passengers on flight 77 used their own personal cellular phones to make out calls during the terrorist attack.

Ok, so it *must* have been a cell phone, and his *first* story turns out to be right... right? Not according to the FBI. In the trial of Zacarias Moussaoui, the supposed 20th hijacker, the FBI report attributed only one call to Barbara Olson and it was an “unconnected call,” which (of course) lasted “0 seconds.” According to the FBI, therefore, Ted Olson did not receive a single call from his wife using either a cell phone or an on board phone. 

**Edit:** Citations [below](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/9c7d7/the_guy_who_won_bush_v_gore_is_taking_samesex/c0c7y26)

**Edit 2:** Bobcat pointed out [below](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/9c7d7/the_guy_who_won_bush_v_gore_is_taking_samesex/c0c80bd) that, [according to the FBI](http://www.fbi.gov/pressrel/pressrel01/100401.htm), Atta and Al-Omari purchased box cutters at Wal-Mart. They presumably had them on AA flight 11. What this means is that Olson's report is not the only mention of box cutters concerning the 9/11 hijackings. 

I did a word search in the [9/11 Commission Report](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.9-11commission.gov%2Freport%2F911Report.pdf&amp;ei=QAKNSpSaGZKDlge0jvz9BA&amp;usg=AFQjCNHGlh1FX-h5OMtRGzOky5zJfmQnbQ&amp;sig2=Z4F9ddrfwOMRrTX6cfqeCQ) but found no instances of ""wal-mart"", ""wal mart"", or ""walmart"" (the search was not case sensitive); if it is not in there, my first sentence is correct still - Olson's was the only testimony that mentioned box cutters. The Commission probably had access to the FBI report, but there is no way to tell if it was noticed or whether it affected the mention of box cutters in the Report.

**Edit 3:** I also want to put this out there: There were two reported callers from AA flight 77, Olson and Renee May. May supposedly called her parents in Las Vegas. What I want to know is, why, if Olson and May were able to make successful calls, did no other passengers get calls out? I would like to see the phone records from the phone company.

Also, to those that would say Olson was confused as to what exactly happened and was said that day, this is from an [MSNBC News](http://web.archive.org/web/20040315121626/http://msnbc.msn.com/id/3067613/) article on Sept. 29:

&gt;As Olson related to NEWSWEEK, Barbara was calm and collected as she told him how hijackers had used boxcutters and knifes to take control of the plane and had herded the passengers and crew to the back. “Ted, what can I do?” she asked him. “What can I tell the pilot?” Then, inexplicably, she got cut off.

**Edit 4:** I found a site that has [4 supposed Airfone records](http://www.911myths.com/index.php/Barbara_Olson_calls) from AA flight 77. The first connected one that lasted a minute, at 7:15am, says the call went to a live operator for a collect call charge verification, which corroborates his *second* story that he told Hannity and Colmes (even though later in the day he told Larry King it was a cell phone). They still don't reflect events as Ted Olson described on Larry King (""She got through again, and we spoke for another 2 or 3 or 4 minutes""). There is only one connection for 59 seconds, all the others are about 10 seconds.

The very first one on the page is the one the FBI attributes to Barbara Olson in their report for the Moussaoui trial.

The second interesting thing from that site is that it gives [this source](http://www.911myths.com/index.php/Image:Team7-Box13-Flight-Call-Notes-and-302s.pdf) that reports the testimony of Ted Olson's secretary Lori Keyton:

&gt;At approximately 9:00am, she received a series of approximately six (6) to eight (8) collect telephone calls. Each of the calls was an automated collect call. There was a recording advising of the collect call and requesting she hold for an operator. A short time later another recording stated that all operators were busy, please hang up and try your call later.

&gt;Keyton then received a collect call from a live operator. The operator advised that there was an emergency collect call from Barbara Olsen for Ted Olsen. Keyton advised that she would accept the call. Barbara Olsen was put through and sounded hysterical. Barbara Olsen said, ""Can you tell Ted.."" Keyton cut her off and said, ""I'll put him on the line.""

&gt;There was a second telephone call a few to five (5) minutes later. This time Barbara Olsen was on the line when she answered. She called direct. It was not a collect call. Barbara Olsen said, ""It's Barbara."" Keyton said, ""he's on the phone with the command center, I'll put you through."" 

The only thing is that there aren't 6 to 8 records showing attempted collect calls.

**Edit 5**: After listening to the [Larry King interview](http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0109/14/lkl.00.html) again from Sept. 14, I noticed Olson said:

&gt;I had to tell her about the two airplanes that had hit the World Trade Center

I wonder if there was any struggle on the plane after she was informed of what had happened to the other hijacked planes. Perhaps if I was on a hijacked plane prior to 9/11 I would just hope that the hijackers demands were met and we'd be let go, but if a passenger said she spoke with her husband over the phone and he informed her that other planes had been similarly hijacked and rammed into skyscrapers, you bet your ass I'd take the plane back or die trying.",['jscoppe'],0,"You know his wife died when the plane she was on slammed into the Pentagon.

"Damn, your kids will never be able to win an argument with you because you *really did* walk 20 miles for school!

Good job though, that's really inspiring.",['bitemark01'],0,"Well, before I went to undergrad, I was homeless. I was 17 years old and hadn't been in school since I was 12 (I was home schooled and my parents divorced). I had no transcripts, no GED, and no family in the state. 
Some friends of mine were visiting a university in a neighboring state and I joined them. I discovered that because my mother (whom I hadn't spoken with in  a year) lived in that state, I could get grants to go there.
I returned to the broken-down Pontiac Grand Am I was sleeping in, determined to go to that university. The first thing I had to do was get a GED. The nearest testing site was over 20 miles away. I didn't have any friends who were willing to drive me there, and as previously mentioned, the car was broken down. So I walked there, took the first days test, and walked most of the way back before a cop picked me up because he'd heard reports of someone walking down the side of the interstate. Fortunately, the cop took mercy on me and drove me to my broke-down car.

A friend heard about what I had done and graciously drove me to the testing site the next day. I finished the GED and prepared to go to the university. 

I showed up at the university with 10$, a GED, no transcripts, and no ACT or SAT. The university said I could sleep in the dorms for the night, but they wouldn't know if they could accept me until I took the ACT the next morning (!). I couldn't sleep that night. I hadn't had any formal schooling since I was 12 and I'd never studied for the ACT in my life. I took the test and scored a 28 (damn that 18 in math...). I was in.
I couldn't afford textbooks for the first 3 semesters, but I borrowed them from friends when I could and worked hard. I managed a 3.0 after the first three semesters and finally got enough money to buy books.
I graduated with a 3.34 and because of my LSAT scores, I received a scholarship to go to law school. I am now about to be a 3L, a year away from being an attorney.

Throughout my educational journey, the 20+ mile walk to get my GED has served as a microcosm of sorts. I was tired, so tired, but I just focused on taking that next step knowing that I was one step closer to where I wanted to be. The thought of my younger siblings pushed me forward. I knew that if I could make it, then they would look to my example and pursue an education as well. As I write this, my youngest brother, now 17, is sleeping in the next room. He lives with me and I am guiding his educational journey. I helped him get his GED and he was recently accepted to a state university where he will major in biology. He aspires to be a doctor. 

tl;dr I was homeless with little education and I had to walk over 20 miles to get my GED. I put myself through college and now I'm almost done with law school. I am now helping my brother reach his educational goals as well.",1819,1819,jakhak212,0,335

"&gt; Dinklebot tells you that nobody gets through their exclusion zone. Which means they're just as important as the machines who's god you killed and the end of the story.

It does?  Wait... No.  No it does not.  Him saying that does NOT make them more important than the final boss.

&gt; That's not my problem

It's not a problem lol.  You complained the game was too short and you used a shitty complaint.  You want to bitch about hours, be ready for someone to reply with hours.

&gt; No, the population wouldn't, the population is already currently upset by the lack of endgame content, so it's likely the exact opposite of what you're saying here.

Your logic is ""they wouldn't because they aren't happy with the amount of content.""  How about we look at Halo PvP maps.  Consistently, around 30% of their maps make up the majority of games played.  New maps *rarely* impacted this.  They kept adding maps, and people kept wanting more maps *and still play only a portion of them.*   So while what you are saying *seems* to make sense... it's wrong.  It's proven by dozens of games that players will focus in on the best content and ignore the majority. 

&gt; They've done it countless times patching entire strats and at times completely reworking the NPCs gameplay to stop a method of a strike or raid because ""it's not how they intended it to be played"" which is never something a dev should tell it's customer

It definitely is something that should be said sometimes.  No group - none at all - is above this ""never"" thing you suggest.",['ha11ey'],0,"&gt;whoa whoa whoa.... What is making you think Cabal are above Vex and Hive? They are easily the least relevant of the races. The Vex and the Hive are the bad guys in this world. The Cabal are almost not in the game.

Whoa whoa whoa, no, there should be more raids, period, it doesn't matter how you feel about a class that had a huge part in the story and how you feel they're unimportant. This entire topic is about farming in a zone that is Cabal. An entire planet on this game is owned by Cabal, Dinklebot tells you that nobody gets through their exclusion zone. Which means they're just as important as the machines who's god you killed and the end of the story.

&gt;Took me 12 hours the first time.

That's not my problem

&gt;ewwww no. Population would just pick 1, maybe 2, that are ""the best"" and that is all we would play. It also means they would have to divide their work up so each raid would have been weaker. Ultimately there would have been one of those 4 raids that just isn't played any significant amount. It would be a massive amount of wasted work.

No, the population wouldn't, the population is already currently upset by the lack of endgame content, so it's likely the exact opposite of what you're saying here. The fact that I can accomplish both Crota and VoG in the same day and be left with glimmer farming for 6 days is a prime example of this, the topic this is posted is is also complaining about this. So this argument makes no sense, you're supporting the lack of endgame content for some reason and that bothers me. 60 dollars for a 10 hour storyline and 2 raids. Next you'll tell me that people don't do the old and new raids in WoW still, oh wait, they do, 10 years later the work still remains unwasted.

They've done it countless times patching entire strats and at times completely reworking the NPCs gameplay to stop a method of a strike or raid because ""it's not how they intended it to be played"" which is never something a dev should tell it's customer, they're there to fix bugs and glitches not stop me from effectively using cover or moving faster than me or hitting slightly harder than normal.",6,6,Tehmaxx,0,-9

reaching arbitrary platforms is not going to be pleasant)

"""Mother fuckin' Happy Feet."" I laughed out loud, for real.",['srucke86'],0,"That's a pretty bad one.  Mine isn't quite that bad, but it's pretty funny.

So I had met this girl online, she was a friend of a friend.  We got to talking for a bit and eventually decided to hang out.  She lived about 30 minutes away in the middle of absolute nowhere, so I had to drive up to meet her.  Since I'm not familiar with the area, I ask her where she would like to eat.  She says, ""Oh well my favorite restaurant is not too far from here.  We can go there.  It's really fancy and expensive, though.""  I told her that I didn't really mind, that I was willing to go where ever, and asked her what the restaurant was called.  She says, ""Oh, it's Red Lobster.""  Now I'm not one to care about how much money people have, but I was quite shocked that she though Red Lobster was a high class establishment.  However, I let it ride, because maybe to her Red Lobster is the epitome of fine dining.

Turns out, Red Lobster is another 30 minutes away.  On the way there we pass a handful of other restaurants.  Olive Garden being one them (this is one of those details that get's dropped in stories very nonchalantly, like hmmm I wonder if this will be important later.  Anyway...).  So we get to Red Lobster and the hostess is walking us to our table.  She seats us, hands us our menus, and begins talking about the specials.  Before she is even able to finish, my date blurts out, ""I already know what want!""  It was so awkward.  She didn't say it in a rude way, she more said it in a more excited way.  Like it was awesome that she already knew what she wanted and everyone needed to know.  Anyway, the hostess is stunned and just kind of walks away.  Eventually the waiter comes to our table and she orders.  She gets, ""Shrimp Alfredo with no shrimp.""  At this point I'm stunned.  She made us drive 30 minutes (which is a long time to spend in a car on a first date) so she could get fettuccine alfredo.  Clearly this was the best restaurant choice and not the Olive Garden.

I still let all of this slide, because at this point she just seemed extremely eccentric and I thought that maybe if I got to know her better than her behavior would be less odd.  After dinner we are closer to my place than hers and she wants to go back to my place to watch a movie.  I oblige (obviously).  We get back there and I ask her what movie she wants to watch.  She picks Happy Feet.  Mother fuckin' Happy Feet.  I guess at this point it's my own fault for even asking.  So we start watching Happy Feet.  She wastes no time in jumping my bones, so I don't make too much of a fuss.

Now the clothes are coming off to the soundtrack of Happy Feet.  Really awkward.  She starts talking about how great she is at giving head as a little warm up dirty talk.  This was surprisingly not as awkward as it could have been (Happy Feet aside) and it was effective.  Then she insists... no... demands that she remove my pants using her mouth.  Now I can see how some people would be into this, but not me.  I tried to talk her out of it, but she was convinced that she was going to do it.  And god bless her, she did.  Button, zipper, and all.  It was still just a really odd thing to do.  Especially on a first date.  Then she gets to the cusp of giving me oral sex, stops, looks up at me and says, ""I don't mess around with guys that are not my boyfriend.  So ask me to be your girlfriend.""  So I did.

Then, in present days, a Japanese fishing ship is being attacked by an unseen monster; only one survived. Traumatized, he is later questioned in a hospital by a mysterious Frenchman and repeatedly says only one word --""Gojira"". NRC scientist Niko ""Nick"" Tatopolous is called in to investigate the matter, and he quickly arrives at the conclusion that a giant, irradiated lizard known as Godzilla has been created by the explosions. Then Godzilla makes its way north, landing at Manhattan to begin wreaking havoc in the big city! Even with the combined forces of the U.S. military are going to destroy Godzilla at all costs, but will it ever be enough to save the people of New York?",361,361,rmk1139,0,110

You're heading north along I-95... going to drive up to New York City.  First you cross the Delaware Memorial Bridge, where off to your right / the east you can see the [Salem Nuclear Power Plant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salem_Nuclear_Power_Plant).  It's cooling towers greet you with a nuclear-powered glow that beckons you forward.

About 15 minutes later you see the [Eagle Point Refinery](http://www.sunocochem.com/products/eagle_pointf.htm) across the other lanes of traffic.  This place is a giant complex of pipes, storage tanks and mechanical buildings... giving off a lovely petrol effervesce which will last until you get to Cherry Hill.

The refinery scent only fades because it is overpowered by the [Melitta Coffee](http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;gs_sm=3&amp;gs_upl=4458l7084l1l7297l21l18l2l0l0l0l320l2222l7.10.0.1l20l0&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.,cf.osb&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=965&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=melitta+coffee,+cherry+hill,+nj&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=us&amp;hq=melitta+coffee,&amp;hnear=0x89c6cb660be23e95:0x35db09ecd8adbdc0,Cherry+Hill,+NJ&amp;cid=0,0,262271413803240760&amp;ei=6gFJT7rDJMiEtgeMyOXwAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=local_result&amp;ct=image&amp;ved=0CDEQ_BI) roasters between exit 3 and 4.  Note, at this point you're realizing the turnpike does not have exit numbers = mile markers like more civilized interstates do.  Oh no, this is NJ... things will be special here.

Around this time you realize you're getting low on gas, so you stop at the lovely (read: not lovely) [rest areas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Turnpike#Rest_areas).  The great thing about these rest areas is that while most of New Jersey enjoys some of the best-priced gas in the nation, you're held captive to the rest areas because you're on a toll road, so enjoy that $.50/gallon premium you're about to pay.  Oh yeah, grandma flips you off as you try to re-merge onto the turnpike.

It's somewhere around mile marker 50 where the perpetual traffic / construction blitz begins.  Until you get to at least Brunswick, you're about to enjoy a traffic jam that moves so slow, you'll wish you had walked.  It's been this way since 1989.

Next up we'll enjoy exit 11, the great mixing bowl where the turnpike meets the parkway.  Here is where all the orange guido people coming up from the shore enter your humble vehicular experience.  Jeep Wranglers with the tops down and fist pumps dominate your rear-view mirror.  The scent of spray tan, exhaust fumes, bad cologne and low tide blend together in an assault on your nostrils.  This is one of those moments in life you will never forget (not the good kind either).

Shortly after passing by the parkway exit, you'll go over the skyway... a lovely elevated section of road where if you look up... you can get your first glimpse of majestic New York City.  But if you look down... you see Jimmy Hoffa's body rotting in the swamp they call ""the Meadowlands"".  This is where the New York Giants play football... so you can expect pretty much everyone to have Giants stickers plastered over their New York Jets stickers plastered over their New York Yankees stickers plastered over their New York Mets stickers.

Finally, 9 hours later, you reach the Holland Tunnel, where after paying over $7.00 in [tolls](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/ef/Njtp.JPG), $80 in gas, and $8.00 for the tunnel (note, you only pay to LEAVE the state, entering is free), you can finally exit the state.  You spiral down into the devil's own asshole, go through a hyper-condensed nasty-smell factory, and emerge into the light... on the New York City side of the tunnel, looking to the sky and the light as if passing through the pearly gates into heaven.

You should edit this post to cry about downvotes too. ,['zeroesandones'],0,"That is not a very good citation. You cited an article on air pressure and drew correlations without scientific evidence.

Here, I did some research my self. You would **NOT** explode unless you held in a lung full of breath(which you aren't likely to do, you would probably scream and lose all of it), and in that case your lung would likely rupture (explode) but you as an individual would NOT.

&gt;When the human body is suddenly exposed to the vacuum of space, a number of injuries begin to occur immediately.

&gt;Though they are relatively minor at first, they accumulate rapidly into a life-threatening combination.

&gt;The first effect is the expansion of gases within the lungs and digestive tract due to the reduction of external pressure.

&gt;A victim of explosive decompression greatly increases their chances of survival simply by exhaling within the first few seconds, otherwise death is likely to occur once the lungs rupture and spill bubbles of air into the circulatory system. Such a life-saving exhalation might be due to a shout of surprise, though it would naturally go unheard where there is no air to carry it.

&gt;In the absence of atmospheric pressure water will spontaneously convert into vapor, which would cause the moisture in a victim's mouth and eyes to quickly boil away.

&gt;The same effect would cause water in the muscles and soft tissues of the body to evaporate, prompting some parts of the body to swell to twice their usual size after a few moments. This bloating may result in some superficial bruising due to broken capillaries, but it would not be sufficient to break the skin.

&gt;Within seconds the reduced pressure would cause the nitrogen which is dissolved in the blood to form gaseous bubbles, a painful condition known to divers as ""the bends."" Direct exposure to the sun's ultraviolet radiation would also cause a severe sunburn to any unprotected skin. Heat does not transfer out of the body very rapidly in the absence of a medium such as air or water, so freezing to death is not an immediate risk in outer space despite the extreme cold.

&gt;For about ten full seconds– a long time to be loitering in space without protection– an average human would be rather uncomfortable, but they would still have their wits about them.

&gt;Depending on the nature of the decompression, this may give a victim sufficient time to take measures to save their own life. But this period of ""useful consciousness"" would wane as the effects of brain asphyxiation begin to set in.

&gt;In the absence of air pressure the gas exchange of the lungs works in reverse, dumping oxygen out of the blood and accelerating the oxygen-starved state known as hypoxia. After about ten seconds a victim will experience loss of vision and impaired judgement, and the cooling effect of evaporation will lower the temperature in the victim's mouth and nose to near-freezing.

&gt;Unconsciousness and convulsions would follow several seconds later, and a blue discoloration of the skin called cyanosis would become evident.

&gt;At this point the victim would be floating in a blue, bloated, unresponsive stupor, but their brain would remain undamaged and their heart would continue to beat.

&gt;If pressurized oxygen is administered within about one and a half minutes, a person in such a state is likely make a complete recovery with only minor injuries, though the hypoxia-induced blindness may not pass for some time.

&gt;Without intervention in those first ninety seconds, the blood pressure would fall sufficiently that the blood itself would begin to boil, and the heart would stop beating. There are no recorded instances of successful resuscitation beyond that threshold.

&gt;Though an unprotected human would not long survive in the clutches of outer space, it is remarkable that survival times can be measured in minutes rather than seconds, and that one could endure such an inhospitable environment for almost two minutes without suffering any irreversible damage.

&gt;The human body is indeed a resilient machine.

"best post I've read all night.

thank you.

to answer that 3-4 champions it'll be 7-8.

no player can play 10-12 champions as easy as you think. you have to play at the top level top item build top teamfight.

even reginald who is a master of karthus makes mistakes non professional league players will not realize this, or if you're a high elo solo queuer who only plays 1-2 champs (inverted) will truely understand what I mean by playing 3-4 champs.

mastering a champ is like... basically Froggen's Anivia. that's a mastered champ. he still needs to pull it out to refresh his memory, it happens for everyone unless you're just a genius with photogenic memory.",['Dyrus'],0,"Ya know. I had a lot of ups and downs with TSM over the last few months and you were my biggest worry. I know my opinion means next to nothing but if you bare with me, there is a silver lining here.

1. I kept watch over your 'secret' scrims(for those wondering, they would leave the game so it didn't show in match history). Saw many champions used and it seems some fell off the table. Was very impressed with what I saw and it seemed INCREDIBLY promising. Frankly, it was refreshing to see a NA team actually take practicing seriously. The only problem was, the practice was little too late.

2. Attitude. We fully understand that streaming brings in quite a significant income. To keep viewers you have to be entertaining. TSM as a whole (yes, even Xpecial) has done a fantastic job and the evidence of that shows not only in the league community, but out in the world. TSM/YOUMADBRO/Fk It Baylife shirts have been popping up more and more (I live in NY, 20min from your old gaming house).  So yes, you guys are fantastic entertainers and have some quite a long way from when you first started in the house BUT that same mentality hindered performance when it mattered.  So I have a few suggestions, take them as you will: 
__________________________________________________________
A- Try to balance the stream time with the practice time. I'm sure you guys will have several discussions in private as to how you guys want to approach S3 but the core thing has to be putting a ton more focus on valuable practice time.

B- You mentioned how you would only learn 3-4 champions in the ""current meta"". In theory that sounds fine, but just think of the likes of M5. Froggen and Alex Ich can pull out 10-12 mid lane champions at any point in time without breaking a sweat. That makes them incredibly versatile and threatening because you simply cannot ban them out. I'm sure your 20+ champion rotation is for that very reason but maybe don't make it SO durastic. Being able to call an audible if your spidey senses are tingling is incredibly valuable.

C- Hire a coach. It's very apparent that the knowledge you guys have is top notch (especially in an arranged 5's setting). The only thing is, taking on a coach has some huge advantages. They can call anyone out on their bullshit without instigating a feud within the team. They can be an honest outside opinion and assess the strengths and weaknesses that maybe the individual or team may have not noticed. Also, just think back to the time with Jonas. There was never a better period for TSM before or after him. He gave a glimpse of what a NA team can deliver.

____________________________________________________________

With that being said, this post you made not only changed my mind about the future of TSM but also my view on you. Even though nobody wants to learn their biggest lessons at some of the worst times, it seems that you did and I commend you heavily for it. Hopefully you take this loss in stride and come back with a new point of view on the NA competitive scene. I'm looking forward to what you guys have to offer and really don't want to see another million bucks go outside of the US. So take some time off, relax, get alllll the shit from S2 out of your head and come back refreshed. I wasn't a fanboy of TSM until I saw this post from you. Keep being honest like this and you will come up on top in S3.

All the best,

Nubaeus

2.) DON'T MAKE A STATEMENT WITHOUT AN ATTORNEY. I SWEAR I HAVE WATCHED EVERY EPISODE OF LAW AND ORDER AND CSI COMBINED, BUT WHEN YOU KNOW YOU DIDN'T DO IT RATIONALITY TAKES OVER. DON'T MAKE THIS MISTAKE...

3.) DON'T TELL THE TRUTH. OK THIS ONE IS A BIT OF A LIE, SHOULD JUST BE FOLDED INTO NUMBER 2 DON'T TALK TO THE POLICE, YOU WILL NOT HELP YOUR CASE YOU WILL ONLY MAKE THEIRS.

I'm not criticizing you, OP.  Almost any normal person would do the same thing.

&gt; when a Detective says they can prove beyond a doubt that you forced your way onto a girl and doesn't arrest you at that moment its hard not to make irrational decisions.

It is.  The rational thing would be to say, ""Well, I'm going to leave now.  Good luck with your investigation."" but all cops do is figure out how to keep you from saying that.

Allow me to provide backstory explaining how HTM got to be what it is today.  You call it a dumping ground; I liken it to a ""melting pot.""

A long time ago there was an idea.  Make a sub where girls try and have a ""normal"" conversation on the phone while getting pounded from behind.  Call it ""hold the phone""--no, call it /r/holdthemoan.  A place where all the best ""sex while on phone"" content would be posted.  Well, the internet had about 30-40 videos before HTM was dead in the water.  There was nothing left to do except repost or let the sub die like thousands of other niche porn subs before it.

*But wait*.

What if we **expanded** the meaning of ""hold the moan"" to include other similar content.  Let's include any situation where girls have to keep quiet while having sex or masturbating next to another, unassuming person.  This opens a whole new world of JAV porn, where girls are having sex next to sleeping husbands or drowsy cousins.

We broke 100 subscribers.. total.

People didn't like the Japanese censorship.  They couldn't see past the pixels, literally.  Another fork in the road.  But /u/escapefromfantasy wasn't giving up.  There was a particular video that got quite a bit of attention despite being censored.  It was a *public* [Japanese scene](https://www.reddit.com/r/holdthemoan/comments/1qv7cf/japanese_girl_has_no_shame_fucks_in_a_public_park/).  Public, huh?  What if we **expanded** the meaning of HTM to include having sex in public but **still** trying to remain hidden?  What if HTM were about ""girls having sex during inappropriate situations?""  We could include a plethora of public videos where girls try and get away with having sex in public.

10,000 subscribers later we decided to test the waters a bit.

Let's try [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/holdthemoan/comments/23sz1p/flasher_in_aisle_five_gif/) out and see how it does.  It's a ""public flash"" without literal moaning.  Well, it became the highest rated post by miles at that time.  A massive success, dwarfing our previous successes.  In the riskiest move we had yet attempted, we decided to **expand** once again (HTM 2.0) our definition, to ""girls getting naughty in socially-risky situations.""  As you can see by the graph depicted in the [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/holdthemoan/wiki/index#wiki_.2B_moans.2C_redefined.) this was the point where we started getting big, really big.  This intentionally vague motto allowed several posts such as [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/holdthemoan/comments/2bh746/lets_see_the_goods_gif/) to be posted here.

---

100,000 subscribers later we still think to ourselves:

Should we let the community decide with votes or act as moderators to remove popular albeit controversial posts?  Perhaps we should allow the community to decide with votes what direction HTM should take; it's worked for us in the past countless times.  After all, the best mods are the ones you don't notice.  But there's a predicament!  Controversial posts.  Shameless sex and public nudity.  There are a lot of upvotes, but also a lot of criticism in the comments.  *Which group of users should we side with?*

Is there a compromise that would benefit both users?  What, in our history, has proven time and time again to be successful in getting HTM active subscribers etc.?  Expanding and overall inclusive mindset was key.  So, we manually re-flaired over 1000 posts for HTM 2.0 to **help users AVOID posts they did not like but at same time allowed those who did like those posts to enjoy.**

There will be confusion.  There will be hate.  But there will be constant re-education of the new subscribers that decide to join this sub of many historical eras, through links to the [HTM wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/holdthemoan/w/#wiki_no_country_for_old_moans) and so on.  This is what got HTM to be where it is today, a top 20 NSFW subreddit bustling with activity and [well-received criticism](https://www.reddit.com/r/holdthemoan/w/#wiki_reddit_acclaim).

Our mods aren't lazy.  They aren't plotting the downfall of HTM.  They aren't indifferent to the pleas of users.

They're unpaid volunteers devoting many hours into keeping the sub clean from hundreds of trolls, spam, and malicious links.  They're working thankless jobs so that the community may reap the benefits.  They're following the exact strategies that helped HTM get to where it is now.",73,73,dehydro,0,-16

"I was required to take nine math and science courses minimum as a liberal arts major.  The fact that, of your nine, two were personal choice means that you require less diversity than a liberal arts degree.  And trust me, a full technical write up for a chemistry experiment, including adjectives, tends to be more comprehensive than one by another.  What changes did the chemicals go through?  Well, those descriptors are adjectives.  Describe the reactions?  Do you just write 'smoke was emitted'?  What color of smoke?  What amount of smoke?  For how long did the smoke emit?  All descriptors.

Yes, people, numbers can be adjectives too!",['Silent_Ogion'],0,"&gt; Actually the issue stems (heh, stems) from just how few liberal arts classes STEM graduates are required to take. They have to take four. That's it. And, as long as they pass with a D it's considered good.

This isn't true at all.  Either that or it's highly dependent on the school you go to and program you take.  For example, I have a BS in Aero and was required to take 21 credits (7 classes) of Social Science/Humanities, on top of two free electives (usually some sort of liberal arts class).  So depending on the free electives that's 9 liberal arts classes people end up with.  Of those 7 required, 4 have to be 300+ level courses which require getting at least a C in the pre-req classes before.

&gt; I'm an English major that took a technical writing class recently. I was the only person in the class that even knew what an adjective is. Not just was I the only one that knew the name for an adjective, but in the first writing assignment (a basic assignment to, apparently, get us all back into the habit of writing again), we peer edited each others papers, and I was the only one that had even used one.

If it's a technical writing class odds are you aren't using a ton of adjectives, that's just not the point of technical writing.  If you're doing a lab writeup you're not going to say things like ""the shiny 6061-AL bar was tested with the burly tensile testing machine and after a paltry 2.3 seconds of being subjected to 1000N it tore apart"".  No.  That doesn't happen.  Tech writing isn't about peppering everything with descriptors...it's meant to be blunt and to the point.  If I went to work on Monday and started peppering adjectives on all my documents I'd be laughed out of the office.

&gt;  But there are also a lot of them out there now that were spoon fed that they didn't need it and it was useless to them (including anything to do with liberal arts), and then the colleges spoon fed them through the classes so they could graduate. And now they're seriously lacking for it.

Again, to be fair once you get into industry the odds of you writing up anything non-technical that doesn't go through Word (which grabs the majority of mistakes) and isn't peer reviewed or looked over by a superior is slim to none.  That, and odds are if it's anything beyond an internal document it'll probably get sent to an actual Tech Writer/Editor that distills it into something that looks pretty and is all grammatically correct.

TL;DR - the point of STEM isn't to teach people how to write pretty.  I mean if you really want to nitpick I can complain about all the English majors who don't know the metric system or basic math (like how to calculate a 20% tip in your head and make change).

Why did you show up in my bedroom at 1:00am the day after leaving me, crying, apologizing for making a horrible mistake, only to leave me all over again in the morning? I would've traveled to hell and back just to make you smile after a bad day at work.  I never in a million years saw this coming.  I hope you know and never forget how completely I love you. I appreciate your every quality and flaw. I hope you read the goodbye letter I wrote you.  I hope if, days or months or years from now, it's 3am and you can't sleep because life is too dark, I hope you call me.

&amp;nbsp;

In the words of our song, ""You'll never know dear, how much I love you, please don't take my sunshine away."" (How goddamn ironic, right? That song has awful lyrics!) I will always look back on our time fondly, and I hope that you do too.  I hate that you were able to do this to me, but I don't regret a single second that our lives were intertwined.

&amp;nbsp;

 I can't forget seeing you, my strong smart beautiful man, crying and huddled on my floor saying, ""I'm scared I'm going to regret leaving you for the rest of my life."" I'm terrified of that too. The mental image haunts me. I know you want to explore the world and find your happiness, but I wish you'd wanted to take me with you instead of feeling you needed to leave me behind.  

&amp;nbsp;

I would've supported you through anything. Hell, I even support you through breaking up with me; I know and saw how difficult it was for you. In a perverse way, I'm almost proud of you for leaving me. (Almost.) You'd resigned yourself to a mediocre job, and in our time together you got even more confident and willing to think outside the box to pursue your own happiness.  You're stronger than me; I'd never have been able to leave you. And if you had to leave me to find yourself, thank you for doing it now rather than after we were married with kids. Please, I beg you, please find your happiness and make this decision worth it.  Don't break anybody else along your journey if you can help it. (You can help it. You're a good man.)

&amp;nbsp;

My entire life, I've been strong, confident, optimistic, and had my life planned out. I've never been even remotely mentally ill before. None of my other relationships affected me like this. Calling off my wedding in college didn't have nearly as much of an effect on me as realizing that you're no longer interested in talking to me. Suddenly I am none of those things and I want none of those things. You showed me the beauty of the smallest things of life, and also spurred on a full-fledged identity crisis and existential crisis. I guess this is what they call situational depression. I had no idea it was possible for ""sad"" to hurt so physically, so completely, and so overwhelmingly to the point where it's difficult to breathe. Don't worry about me, sweetheart, I got some xanax.

&amp;nbsp;

I can survive not being in a relationship with you, maybe, but I don't know how to survive you no longer caring about me or wanting to talk to me. Conceptually, I can understand your reasoning, but that's no help to me when I see anything that reminds me of you, which cues me to once again stare off into space wondering when you stopped loving me. Wondering T what point I suddenly was no longer your first priority in life, to the point that practicalities took precedence over me.  I don't want you back, I don't want to tie you down, but please call me. Please check on me and ask how I'm doing. I'm giving you the space you wanted, but every passing day without a text makes me feel more disposable. Which is a shame since I'm a goddamn catch for a girlfriend. I'm not angry, I'm just disappointed. Please miss me sometimes.
 
&amp;nbsp;

Please wear the clothes I got you for Christmas; you look fantastic in them and you'll........You'll need them when you start dating again.  Please also hang up the poster I made you for Christmas, even though I wrote ""Love forever, [my name]"" on the corner since I worked on it for months and didn't see this coming.  It doesn't deserve to be tossed in a corner and forgotten just because it reminds you of me.  I wear the necklace you got me every day. One day I'll move on, because some teeny tiny spark in me isn't ready to give up on life yet, but for right I can't even fathom trusting somebody else with whatever is left of my heart, so at least for now, the necklace is comforting. 

&amp;nbsp;

Honestly, though, I forgive you for everything. I know you so well and I know how unfulfilled you feel.  I hope you find what you're looking for in life, even if it isn't me.  I'm so happy that you don't know I cry 10x a day now, because it would hurt you to know how much I'm hurting, and I don't want you to hurt. I hope you think I'm happy, because that will make your life so much easier than knowing I'm hope I don't wake up anymore.  I'm flying to your hometown tomorrow -- a city that I hate, but where we were supposed to be moving together -- to look at the job that I applied for when we were together.  

&amp;nbsp;

I'm not vain or irrational enough to think my story is unique, or that my breakup is worse than any other, or that my love was more true or perfect or special than the billions of other romances through history, but fuck, it sure felt like it. 

&amp;nbsp;

I'm pretty sure I'm too stubborn to kill myself, but if the plane crashes, I hope you find your glasses in my dresser; I kept them safe for you.  I never want my apartment key back from you.
&amp;nbsp;

Edit to add: I miss you with every molecule of my body. But even more than that, I miss who I was when I was with you.  I miss the me before you shattered my remaining naivete about how the world works.  I'm going to keep trying to remember how to care about anything, but I can't trust people, I can't trust my own judgment, I can't trust my own thoughts (mere chemical reactions? a soul?). Life is such a fleeting, fickle, meaningless thing and yet I wanted to spend it with you. I would give anything just to know what you're thinking right now. We used to joke that I could read your mind.  I want to buy you a souvenir from my trip, but I guess I won't.  I sleep with a nightlight now.  I trust that you won't tell anybody.

On your turn you have 3 options involving throwing the hammer. It has to fully rotate at least once, and you must catch it with the handle with the same hand you threw it. 

The most basic toss is straight up, flip it and catch. This gives you 1 whack on a nail. Slightly harder is a toss under your leg which gives you 2 whacks on a nail, and the hardest is behind the back which gives 3 whacks. 

If you drop the hammer or catch it with the head of the hammer you forfeit your turn and pass to the next person and drink. Successful hits on someone elses nail makes them drink. They chug if eliminated. If you miss on an attempt to hit a nail you drink. Now if a nail gets hit and bent it creates an obvious advantage for that person.

Hi, I just explained this move with one sentence from the article.

2. Oil companies bitch and moan and pitch a fit and the futures exchange goes insane about prices, sending PpB skyrocketing unlike anything we've seen since OPEC used the Oil Weapon in the 70s.

3. Gasoline prices in the US approach the world average. 

4. Americans go nuts because they can't get their fix (oh, and incidentally, underfunded public transportation and public institutions like fire/police/municipal first responders take a big thick one up the behind, too-- unsustainable big government, right?)

5. Fox News gives it a fancy name like Obama's Oil Blunder and claim he's trying to create an underclass unable to resist his communist fascism or whatever. The rest of the idiot box crowd report on Fox News' outrageousness instead of doing any mental heavy lifting because, to be honest, they are completely unused to effort at this point.

6. GOP: Why does Obama hate industry?

7. Forbes Magazine and WSJ: Why u do this Obama?

8. Obama: ""Completely reasonable response implicating GOP using facts and logic.""

9. GOP &amp; ETC: ""OMG USE SOME TACT RESPECT CIVILITY YOU FUCKING HITLER CLONE FROM KENYA""

10. Obama caves in the name of bipartisanship. Oil prices stay high.

GET A GUN.,['UnevolvingMonkey'],0,"Though not a typical scenario, I can offer up a warning for men that might want to step in and help her out.

I used to work at night, down-town, and I would commute on my bicycle.  I'd often be cruising home when the bars were hopping and would see all kinds of drunk shenanigans.  One night I'd just passed the main street and was heading down a darker side-road when I saw a young woman, crying, unable to walk, just completely trashed.  There were a couple of fratty guys kind of laughing at her, testing their boundaries, clearly looking to take advantage of the situation.  Real sketchy.  I did the typical *""Katie?  Wow, you're trashed!  Everyone is looking for you back at [club name].""*  -something like that.  Then, I locked my bike up and walked her to the closest bar, where I asked the bouncer if he'd seen her earlier that night, and if she had any friends.  In the middle of that, the drunk gal spotted a friend just inside the door and screamed out for her.  As soon as her friend gets close, the lady I was helping yells at me, really loud *""Who are you?  Why are you touching me?  Help!  Get off of me! HELP!""*  Within two seconds she went from being very appreciative to pushing away in disgust.  If that bouncer hadn't been there, knowing that I was just bringing this poor woman back to her friends, my ass would have been pounded by the twenty pissed off dude-bros who'd heard her protest.

Doing the right thing made me feel like shit, people were hooting and hollering at me like I was a creep.  I had to get the hell out of there ASAP.  

Not saying that I wouldn't do it again, and please don't let my story prevent you from helping someone.  Guys should just keep in mind that if they end up in a similar situation, find another woman or friendly group to help, immediately, because you can go from good-guy to bad-guy very quickly when alone.

On a similar note, one night on that same block, I spotted three guys picking on a little Asian dude, shoving him, being racist, and what-not.  I stopped and told them to cool it.  Me and my new Asian friend then got our asses kicked by three frat bros, yey!  :D

Doesn't the West use Chinese labour? That sounds pretty hypocritical.,['vicelio'],0,"The FIFA World cup (soccer) has been voted on to be held in Qatar in 2022, almost everyone universally agrees that the vote was corrupt.

Now there are many problems with holding the world cup in Qatar, 1st being that in the summer it can get up to 40°c (or over 100°F) which is much to hot for players to play safely (or spectators stay safe). The second is that Qatar has been using slave labour to build the stadiums that are supposed to hold the tournament, with many being worked to death in these places because they cannot leave as their passports have been taken.

FIFA is the governing body of world football and is the association that almost all national teams belong to. The guy who runs it at the moment has been in for the last 25 years, has been resistant to any changes that could improve the game (like TV replays or Goal line technology) and is generally seen as very corrupt. (last election he ran unopposed). The bidding process for hosting the tournament has been proven for at least one of the voting panel to be corrupted.

So what the OP is suggesting is that the World Cup is boycotted by all the teams who think it shouldn't be played there and that there should be another world cup somewhere else (I think Australia has been suggested multiple times because they hosted a very well done Asian cup and it would be somewhere outside of the traditional places (Europe/South America) which is the given excuse for holding it in Qatar.",80,80,Nymain,0,-19

"YEA, REALLY, THE UNFORTUNATE PART IS THAT BATTLE.NET IS BRINGING DOWN STARCRAFT 2 WITH IT.

STARCRAFT 2 IS IS AN AMAZING, BRILLIANT, AMAZING, ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE OF A GAME. THERE ARE BALANCE ISSUES AND THINGS HERE AND THERE, BUT IT IS PRESENTED AMAZINGLY - AND I THINK I WOULD BUY IT FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN OF THE SINGLE PLAYER SERVICE ALONE.

HOWEVER, THINGS LIKE THE FACEBOOK INTEGRATION LOOK LIKE FAR MORE OF AN ATTEMPT TO ADVERTISE THE GAME (AND WOW, WHICH THEY ARE ALSO INTEGRATING INTO THE SAME SYSTEM) AND PULL MORE PEOPLE INTO IT THAN IT IS TO ACTUALLY UTILIZE IT AS A BETWEEN-PLAYER COMMUNICATION MEDIUM.

BATTLE.NET IS NO LONGER A SERVICE FOR FANS. IT IS A SERVICE FOR BLIZZARD TO SUCK MORE PEOPLE IN AND MAKE MORE MONEY. THEY REALLY WANT TO CHARGE PEOPLE A MONTHLY FEE TO PLAY SC2, I CAN ALMOST GUARANTEE IT. BUT THEY DON'T BECAUSE THEY FEEL THAT WOULD BE -TOO- CROSSING THE LINE, BECAUSE THEY HAVE ASSURED THAT IT WILL BE FREE. I DO THINK IT IS AN UNFORTUNATE POSITION THAT BLIZZARD IS IN. I REALLY WANT TO BELIEVE - AND I THINK THE ARTICLE WRITER DOES, TOO - THAT REALLY IT IS BLIZZARD BEING FORCED INTO A CORNER BY THE ACTIVISION BUYOUT. AND, TO BE QUITE FRANK, A LOT OF THIS IS ALMOST DIRECTLY TRACEABLE IN WOW TO WHEN ACTIVISION PURCHASED IT.

THE UNFORTUNATE PART IS THAT SHORT TERM, ACTIVISION WILL PROBABLY PROFIT FROM THIS. THEY WILL ALSO MANAGE TO ERODE BLIZZARD'S CUSTOMER CONFIDENCE AND LOYAL CUSTOMER BASE IN THE PROCESS.

THE SC2 BETA TEST IS NOT A BETA FOR IT. STARCRAFT 2 IS GOOD. THERE ARE MINOR ISSUES, BUT IT'S READY TO RELEASE. IT'S BATTLE.NET, AND WHAT I'VE SEEN ON BATTLE.NET REALLY MAKES ME QUESTION IT. AS I SAID, I THINK I WOULD BE WILLING TO BUY SC2 AS JUST A SINGLE PLAYER GAME... HOWEVER, I FIND MYSELF DISGUSTED BY THE FEATURE-REMOVAL AND OBVIOUS MONEY-GRABBING TECHNIQUES THAT ARE PUT IN BATTLE.NET THAT I DON'T WANT TO GET THIS BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO SUPPORT THESE TYPE OF PRACTICES OF PROMISING YOUR CUSTOMER SOMETHING, DELIVERING SOMETHING NOT ONLY COMPLETELY DIFFERENT - BUT ABSOLUTE GARBAGE THAT IS NOTHING BUT A THINLY VEILED ATTEMPT TO SUCK MONEY OUT OF PEOPLE.

SINCE I FIRST PURCHASED WARCRAFT 2, I HAVE BOUGHT EVERY SINGLE BLIZZARD GAME THAT CAME OUT EITHER ON ITS RELEASE OR AS SOON AFTER ITS RELEASE THAT I COULD AFFORD IT.

If you have two coin flips, there are four possible outcomes.  HH (Two heads in a row), HT(A heads and then a tails), TH, and TT.  You'll notice that in two of the four cases, you end up with a heads and a tails 50%.  Meanwhile it's less likely to get two heads.  The probability of getting two heads in a row is 25%.  Intuitively, it makes sense that if you already have on heads, the next will be tails because two heads in a row only happens 25% of the time, but this thinking is flawed.  We already have one heads.  That eliminates two of the cases (TH and TT) so we're left with HH and HT.  One case you get your second flip to be heads, the other it's tails.

Fast food places make a lot of their money on combo meals. Getting people to throw down a couple more dollars for the higher end burgers and fries means a lot more profit.

YOU ARE NOT AN INTELLIGENT MAN ,['Steams'],0,"That's a false analogy, because one portal has velocity and the other is stationary. In the scene you describe, both sides of the door share the same velocity. 

The best way to think of this problem is by turning it into a portal scenario we are used to, by taking an inertial frame where the velocity of the entrance portal is zero. In this case, it is the box that is moving with a certain velocity towards the portal. As we know, speedy thing goes in, speedy thing comes out, so the box would leave the exit portal with the velocity it appeared to enter it with, thus the answer is B.

Here is the way I look at it: Private Charity works. Private military doesn't work. That's why we allow the federal government to take care of the military - because it isn't something that can be done locally or privately.
Beyond that, how much we spend on the military can be debated.

Criticising the black community for their response to the OJ trial is missing the bigger picture.

When a black guy went on trial for the murder of a white woman it was almost taken as a given he was guilty and for him to be found not guilty was near enough unprecedented.

"To be honest, the people that don't like the game or have real criticism are downvoted in reddit. Sure there are flame posts but there are real criticisms about this game that are entirely overlooked because of the hype. (I think the constructive reviews and criticism is really saying something!) Mostly this is due in part because of the intense fanboy-ism this game has which is really surprising. Much like how people rage over the criticism over Dark Knight Rises, people will rage if someone says their game isn't the greatest thing known to man. 

That being said, the ""good reviews"" of this game are very biased. People are really buying in to the false model of a ""classless no level"" game with many out dated mechanics. It's.. interesting to say the least.

It's not a great game, but it's not terrible. 

I wouldn't base my entire opinion of a game with a metacritic score. Most of the reviewers are biased players that want to make the game look better than anything else out there whom, like the Dark Knight Rises example, will rage and try to boost it as much as possible to make that giant e-peen grow. A lot of these players have even stated ""They don't play MMO's!"" I mean, if you love a game don't you want to make it look as awesome as possible and get others to play it too? I totally understand the mentality. But, it's false advertisement in a way. Of course, one would have to perpetually think that metacritic is the end all be all; though, I'd hate to buy into the hype, play the game, and realize it wasn't what was said. I think if Funcom didn't try to promote their game to be this glorious piece of work that is revitalizing the industry, it wouldn't be taking so much flak (because simply it isn't). Yes, it's different but not up to the standards it portrays.

I was barely eating as it was and would count every single calorie I consumed.

I left New York and got a different job that allowed me to drink beer (impossible when modeling) and eat normal, healthy amounts, so naturally I gained weight. It was horrible. I cried sometimes and would stand in the mirror for so long wondering if I could find a healthy way to stay so so skinny. There wasn't, and it took me a very long time to realize that in the real world, I was normal and even thin. Sorry to go off on a rant but the bottom line is I would comment on my weight gain to people close to me and they would dismiss me instead of supporting me. If more people had been concerned about my comments instead of annoyed by them, I would have gotten better and come to terms with my new body much quicker.

"Most german schools wait for their students to have a certain ""maturity"" before they tackle the topic. In most cases, WW2 gets discussed once in 9th/10th grade and then a little more in-depth in ""Oberstufe"" (11th/12th grade) Things like the ""Nuernberger Prozesse"" require a good amount of moral reflection from their students. And like most other german redditors said, every detail not only of the holocaust itself but also the political and social origins of right-wing-extremism and antisemitism in germany gets carefully discussed. 

Most students are able to observe the topic rather objectively, even *if* their grandparents have actively participated in the persecution of jewish people. I've never seen anyone really get ""emotional"" in these history lessons (not more than any other), though that may just be true for the courses I sat in.

Personally, my mother told me about the holocaust very early. Though granted, not in it's full, horrible detail (I think that might have been too much for 8-year old me).

WE CAN KEEP TRYING TO IGNORE THE ROOT ISSUE OF THE PROBLEM, AND INSTEAD PUT A BAND-AID ON IT, BLAME IT ON SOME GROUP OR PERSON (IN THIS CASE, SNOWDEN) AND HOPE FOR THE BEST OR WE COULD ADDRESS THE REAL ISSUE WHICH IS THE US IMPERIALISTIC FOREIGN POLICY. IF YOU THINK THAT PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO BLOW THEMSELVES UP BECAUSE HATE THAT THE US IS ""PROSPEROUS AND FREE"", THEN YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY MAD. IT'S EVEN MORE FOOLISH TO THINK THAT A MAN WHO BLEW THE WHISTLE ON A HUGE GOVERNMENT SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM WHICH COMPLETELY IGNORES US CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS OF IT'S CITIZENS DOESN'T DESERVE A FAIR TRIAL FOR HIS ""CRIMES"".  ",['averageworker'],0,"Are we to believe the lawyers for the US government told snowden's legal team that they are going to illegally sway the justice system against him?

Or is snowden referring to a scenario where he won't be getting a simple slap on the wrist for directly damaging the national security of the US?  If he would have exposed only the domestic spying programs, my guess is that he'd be on a cross-US book tour right now.  By also releasing foreign espionage capabilities, he has caused damage to the US' foreign espionage methods and access, which has an impact to national security.

*edit because there seems to be confusion that snowden leaked only domestic spy programs, when he, in fact, revealed some apparently highly sensitive foreign espionage methods against a host of adversaries, including china and Russia.  There also seems to be questioning about what a lack of information about adversary intentions could really harm.  Imagine playing 'battleship,' but because only one side's espionage was revealed, one player gets to play with full knowledge of his opponent's ship coordinates, while the other is unaware.

Here's one small, localized example of what implications that denying insight into a foreign regime's intentions impacts the West's security:

&gt;You know there have been two categories of leaks, right?  One is a completely justifiable leak which exposes our governments covert espionage and data collection against masses of US citizens.  The other leak reveals the most sensitive foreign espionage techniques and access.  Just one of the millions of document leaks revealed that the US had access to closed information networks of countries, like china, who've been increasing their military expenditure by double digit percentages and constantly practices island invasions off their east coast, not coincidentally near Taiwan and the disputed islands of SE Asia.  One implication of the specific leaks of the US' methods and access to secure communication is that the West may be denied the special information that differentiates a massive training exercise from indicators of a pending invasion.  Considering the US is treaty bound to protect Taiwan, for example, denying the US a chance to put in place preventative measures may actual lead to hostilities and put the US response in a disadvantaged position, costing US lives.  

&gt;Now extrapolate that example across the globe.  The West could lose access to intentions and capabilities of thug regimes across African, Asia, Europe.  If an individual leaks information that literally and definitely endangers US national security, they will not receive a slap on the wrist.",62,62,potato_bus,0,-7

"That's part of keeping the marriage so amazing. If you're a man... BE a man. Seduce her mind, seduce her soul, seduce her body, and seduce her in a way that leaves her no choice except to get swept up in the moment. When you're laying there next to each other, her head on your chest, you want her to be saying in her mind ""this is MY man.. this is MY man.. omg this is MY MAN!""

Some more things I will do to keep my wife satisfied..

There are days we won't be able to text or call each other because we're so busy. In the event this happens, I'll find out when she is going to be home. I clean up the house, clean up the bathroom, kitchen, all that goodness and take a shower. Then I'll throw a nice red in the freezer 30 minutes before I know she'll be home, pour the glasses, and light candles all over the house. When she walks in, I greet her with a wordless kiss, hand her the glass of wine, and drink in her body with my eyes while drinking from the glass. In between sips, we'll use body language and eye contact to say what needs to be said. Most of the time, that glass of wine goes warm. 

Both of us do work/research that requires isolation for it to be done best. We know that when we're in study mode not to bug each other because 1) not in the mood 2) really need to focus on our shit and 3) things gotta get done. However... if one of us gets the urge, we'll go into wherever the other is studying at, put their laptop out of reach, close whatever book (after marking the page of course), and make out with each other until clothes come off (not always, but most times) and we've made each other breathless. Then we walk out with a kiss and go back to our work.

I also like to tease her.. a LOT. Especially when I know she can't pull out her toy and relieve the tension. I'll send her texts, suggestive pictures, and tell her a story of the things her body will experience when I see her next. It drives her crazy and as soon as she gets home it's like ""You! FUCK me!""

A lot of keeping my marriage so fulfilling and loving is I never stop seducing the woman I love. I don't ask her permission to show her how much I love and appreciate her; I tell her. I notice all the small things she does. I notice when she changes her hair. I notice when she wears a different pair of shoes or does her makeup different. I pick up on all the unexpected surprises that are her way of showing she loves me. I recognize them and I always make sure she knows I appreciate them. This also means I never ask for permission to make love to her... I tell her through my body and soul in a way that sends shocks through her body until I sweep her up release the tension for both of us.

Instead, they'd rather teach about a period in Europe where nothing even fucking happened ...

I mean, just in general it gets pretty annoying. The Mexica that were conquered by the Spanish had better hygeine than most of Europe, had  education for girls and for the poor (something most of Europe lacked), and they had one of the largest cities in the world during the 1400's, yet most people don't know anything about them except human sacrifice. It's kind of sad, really.

"&gt;I hate that attitude!

RTFA

&gt;Asking questions about performance online universally invites scorn and accusation. A large number of programmers apparently feel that the efficiency of code is nowadays insignificant. So long as the functional requirements have been met the approach is golden. Any attempt to discuss improvements is met with stiff resistance. The most common of the mantras are “premature optimization” and “have you measured it”.

&gt;While at times such notions may not be misguided, this general attitude towards ignoring performance considerations is quite dangerous. **Let’s look at a few reasons why performance is still quite relevant**, especially early in the development process.",['Xarnon'],0,"I hate that attitude! I was working on a web app that was already using three large Javascript libraries, and we needed to add another feature, so somebody included another large Javascript library. I called him on it and he just said ""You have to use the best tool for the job."" The result was a user interface that had the features the client wanted, but was slow to load, slow to respond, and difficult to maintain. That company no longer sells that web app.

Another time I made a php script for an alphabet-based browser bar, the kind where you click on a letter of the alphabet and it gives you a list of items from a database starting with that letter. I made it so letters which would yield no data wouldn't be clickable, to save the user from fruitless clicking on empty letters.

Not wanting to bog the system down, I did some profiling on it to see how much actual time my algorithms were taking. Turned out to be not that much real time, but it came to around 3 billion cpu operations. If I had written the same kind of thing on the hardware we used when I first started programming, it would have taken about 50 minutes just to produce the bar. Of course, we didn't have php then, so I would have written it in C, and then it would have taken far fewer cpu cycles.",10,10,mutatron,0,-8

"They would also undoubtably slow the connection down to the standards of the 56k modem, unless you wanna pay $50 more for the premium connection",['Randompaul'],0,"In a nutshell:

Your power grid is neutral.  You can plug in any standardized appliance to any standardized outlet in your home.  No one else on the grid can pay more money than you to ensure that they get some ""higher quality"" power, or still get power when you have a blackout.  The power company doesn't charge you a tiered pricing structure where you can power your refridgerator and toaster for $10 per month, and add your dryer for $20 more, and then add in a range, foreman grill and curling iron for an additional $30 on top of that.

If your appliance fits in the standardized plug, you get the same power that everyone else does.


Your cable TV is not neutral.  You pay one price for maybe 20 channels, and then tack on an extra $50, and you get $100 channels and a cable box.  For another $40, you get ""premium"" channels.  If your cable company doesn't carry the channels you want, it's just too bad.  You can't get them.


The large telecoms and cableco's aims to gut the internet as we know it.  As it stands, you plug in your standardized computer to your standarized outlet, and, assuming that you have service, you can get to any website on the net.  The telecoms and cableco's want to make it so that if you pay $10 a month, you get ""basic internet"", maybe only getting to use the cableco's search engine, and their email portal. For $20 more, they'll let you get to Google, Twitter and MySpace.  For $40 on top of that, you can get to Facebook, YouTube and Reddit.  For $150 a month, you might be able to get to all the internet sites.


On top of that, the cableco's and telecoms want to charge the provider, which could be Google, YouTube, Twitter, Reddit, etc, to allow their websites to reach the cableco/telecom's customers.

So, not only are you paying your ISP to use Google, but Google has to pay your ISP to use their pipes to get their information to you.

That is why people who get this large vehicles are douchebags. They are put everyone else at *greater* risk for their own benefit which forces everybody else to retaliate to reduce their own risk and in the end we are all worse off, not better off.

Then there is the fact that these bigger vehicles are actually more likely to roll over because of their higher center of gravity, and more likely to rear-end you because they break slower due to the added kinetic energy of the big mass.

This subreddit is definitely not a place for me to find tunes... the majority of the stuff posted here is the soulless warble stuff, and what decent tunes are posted, I've unfortunately already heard. I've been listening to dubstep since around '06, so trust me, I've heard it almost all. 

I don't have a problem with it evolving or getting popular. Dubstep's been relatively popular in the UK ever since Dubstep Warz. I don't have a problem with evolution either. Just take a listen to Swamp81 and Hessle Audio stuff. That's the fucking future of dubstep right there. 

The problem is that this offshoot of dubstep has lost absolutely everything that was special to dubstep in the first place. **I don't give a fuck if people want to listen to their robot sounds and aggro wobbles**, with straight hi hats and white noise snares.

Guess what, we still go see the DJs and artists we like, and actually take the time to find new artists and listen to them. Just because you don't like it doesn't make it ""inferior"". I'm a DJ/Producer and while I like the softer side of dubstep that you mentioned (I actually frequently play DMZ and stuff from Soul Jazz on my colleges radio station), i love mixing up the heavy filthy from Rottun and driving around with Triage/SPL destroying my car sound system.


There are tons of artists that have both the midrange AND the bass AND a groove to it. Obviously if you stick to this subreddit you won't hear a lot of the stuff you like, but it's definitely out there.

Sorry for the rant, but overgeneralizations really piss me off. I've invested a lot of time into this particular genre and it irks me when people try to pick it apart simply because it started evolving and getting popular.

The reason the joke made me laugh is cause I read it as a joke. Jokes are structured on a collective knowledge, conscience. In this case that knowledge is that lesbians don't want a penis and thus a dildo shouldn't be their thing either. An audiences collective assumption on a subject is why jokes work. 
Cameron Esposito tweeted this recently for example: ""Um there's an all white men's college basketball team at the Minneapolis airport. Should I trap them for study?"" Because everyone assumes there are always a lot of black guys on basketball teams. 
Once you start deconstructing the joke of course it doesn't make sense. There are plenty of talented white basketball players, enough to fill more than one team. 
I don't start complaining to someone when they tell a joke that it's completely unreasonable that someone let a horse in a bar and all the bartender does is ask why he has a long face.

With all the hubbub about MVC these days, it's sad that what's quickly replacing desktop applications is so archaic at the core.

This is all made so much worse by cross-browser compatibility wars, aka ""GTFO Opera and Explorer"".  I realize many will argue with that, but Microsoft has yet to release a version of their web browser that complies with W3C standards.

HTML5 and CSS3 are being finalized, yet every utilization of their new features requires more work to degrade gracefully if you want to make your work accessible to the corporate, academic, and over 50 world.  JavaScript is such a powerful language, but where it fits in within its current context just feels ""blah"".

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.... THE NEXT WES ANDERSON FILM.,['g10tto'],0,"I lived in Nigeria when I was 3 and 4 years old, we moved from England.  I was the curly headed super blond kid that Nigerians were fascinated with.  When we were out of the cities I would draw a nice crowd of Nigerian women and my dad would tell them they could take me home and I would run and hide.  I would trade candy and chips for sugar cane with the neighboring kids.  The people across the street had a monkey but mum said I was not allowed to play with it.  I played with that monkey every chance I got, it was like a kid and very gentle.

Edit: Just adding another fun Africa story...My dad built us a wooden house to play in out of a large wood packing case that some of our furniture was shipped in.  The wooden house sat up on blocks about 10 inches off the ground.  Dad saw me poking around under the house with a stick.  He left me to it.  He saw me still at it 10 minutes later so he came over and asked what I was doing.  3 year old me informed him that I was just trying to get a snake out from underneath the house.  He looked behind the house and saw the last 6 or 7 feet of a giant snake slipping away under the fence.  He said it would have easily killed me, maybe even eaten me.

Edit 2: Here is another one...In Nigeria there are huge termite colonies that are all over the place once you start looking for them.  You would never see the termites because they live underground and stay there.  The only time you would see activity would be when they were mating.  At a certain time of the year, (after a rain storm that would soften the ground so the termites could start a new home) billions of termites would take to the air.  Winged male and female termites would burst forth from the giant nests and fly around to meet a mate from another nest.  They would go towards lights so you had to watch out for them in your house.  We had gone out for the night and the lights were on in the house with windows open.  The swarm entered!  We had millions on flying termites in our house, everywhere.  When a termite meets a mate they couple up and immediately drop off their wings so we had little snow drifts of [termite wings](http://www.visualphotos.com/image/1x9129060/mass_of_shed_termite_wings_after_the_swarm_kenya) six inches deep in some rooms and termites running all over the place.

DO AN IAMA WITH PICS,['TheDevilChicken'],0,"There are different kinds of behaviors exhibited by different kinds of seizures.  For some types of partial complex seizures (the type I used to have), the symptoms are no more than staring off into space for about half a minute and perhaps some puckering, kissing, and lip-smacking movements of the face.  The auras (pre-seizure symptoms) that epileptics experience can also be quite varied - some will experience certain tastes, smells, tingling sensations, visual hallucinations, disorientation, or even (the symptoms I had) intense feelings of deja vu and precognition.

Damage does occur to people when they have seizures, and it's not damage from them banging into things.  When I had surgery to remove the fingernail-sized scar/cell cluster that was starting my seizures, the surgons nearly wet their pants over what they found under my skull.  Years of taking anti-seizure meds had only masked the symptoms and I was suffering brain damage from each seizure.  A good chunk of my brain had been killed, and the dead tissue had crystalized so that it looked like lemonade mix.  Pictures of the inside of my head are now part of a lecture series at USC to demonstrate how multiple kinds of MRIs are sometimes worthless for showing what is going on inside of someone.  They removed the dead tissue, and now I'm out 19% of my right temporal lobe.

For epileptics on anti-seizure medications, taking their meds on a regular schedule is very important for controlling their condition, and not something they try to fit into a 6-hour window or something as precise as a phone company appointment (sometime between 8am and 12pm) - it's more like a 1-hour window several times a day.  A delay in medication by as few as 2-4 hours can trigger a seizure all by itself.

A lot of people that have epilepsy also wear medic-alert bracelets, necklaces, and/or have cards in their wallets describing their condition and their treatment regimen, as well as contact info for their neurologist.",212,212,chilehead,0,70

It teaches them that taking out your anger on someone is necessary and sufficient to make them see the errors of their ways. In reality, many of those children will likely grow up and have kids of their own, and use the same violent tactics to punish their wrongdoings. These tactics are not just limited to raising kids.

Whether you have a predisposition to something or a desire to do something, you curb that thought because you know it's wrong and you *choose* not to do it. The OP wasn't ""attacking someone because of how their bran is wired,"" they were attacking someone who chose to act in a morally reprehensible way instead of choosing to deny their desires.

"Having an ""animal rights mindset"" isn't synonymous with having a Bambi view of nature where all the animals frolic together and only eat grass followed by an evening of snuggling. It's possible to simultaneously believe that sentient beings capable of pain shouldn't have needless pain inflicted on them while understanding that nature is cruel. That's sort of the point: as advanced primates we've evolved to a point where we can reflect on our actions rather than merely participating in nature in an unthinking way.

And it also isn't synonymous with sitting behind a laptop and telling someone they're a bad person followed by other people sitting behind a laptop getting engaged in the drama and saying that no, actually, the initial accusers were bad people. Like some sort of trashy celebrity magazine producing drama for nerds (as a proud self-identified nerd).

Single white male traveller living in Turkey and just returned from a visit to Egypt I expected a few questions and I got them. At the pre check-in questioning, first one then two attractive young ladies began to talk to me about my trip. They were very friendly but I could tell they knew exactly what they were doing. My bag was on the table between us and although they didn't open it, one would reach over and fidget with it while the other watched me intently. The thing that I really found interesting was that sometimes they would lean over to look at my bag or ticket and give me a good view down their shirts which were open one button too far. Again, I'm sure this had the purpose of putting me off balance or something. During our loooooong talk, they would seem almost chatty and then stop and create an uncomfortable silence. No doubt this was another test of my reaction. I knew what they were doing and found it fascinating. They were perfectly polite for the 20 minutes or so we talked. 

I must have done something wrong because all of a sudden I was asked to go with another guy to a side room where my bag was examined. Everything and I mean everything was opened and examined. They would squeeze my toothpaste tube etc. to feel for anything hard inside before x-raying it. They felt the sides of my bag and shave kit for false linings. It was very professional and they were businesslike but polite. They even snapped a picture to test my camera (film kind) which I didn't appreciate. This search took about another 25 minutes. Strangely, they never searched me. I just went through the normal metal detector. 

All in all, it was no hassle and they were nice. You could tell they were extremely well trained and professional. That kind of security I'd be happy to go through again. ",522,522,mudwilly,0,187

"The problem I have with Condit in this fight is that he threw weak attacks and never attempted to finish.  Same problem I have with GSP, and I do think that a GSP fight would have had the same result, with DIaz being out pointed.  Every time Condit landed anything at all, he backed off and reset the fight, never pressing an advantage or going for a win by knockout or submission.

Condit threw his combos with little power and never followed threw anything he landed.  Compare that with the Nelson Werdum fight.  Werdum got rocked in R1, but he was still confident enough to attempt to finish Nelson, and take advantage of the chances  his striking got him.  If Werdum fought the way Condit did, the fight would have been 1 knee, back off, let Roy recover, throw weak combos with no intent of finishing, back off, lat Roy recover, throw a combo and add a knee, back off and let Roy recover, etc.

 IN TRADING CARD GAMES THEY OFTEN HAVE VERY RARE OR COLLECTIBLE CARDS, HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF YOU WERE INTO THAT KIND OF THING, OPENED A PACK, AND GOT SOMETHING REALLY RARE THAT WAS POTENTIALLY WORTH MONEY? BUT WAIT, HERE IS THE CATCH, THE GAME DECIDES A FEW MONTHS LATER THAT THEY COULD JUST RELEASE THAT CARD FOR ANYONE TO BUY FROM THE STORE, MAKING IT INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE ""REAL"" CARDS YOU ONLY COULD GET IN BOOSTERPACKS.

To give you an example: when my friends dad died back in '97, he left behind a pied-a-terre in an industry town in the North. My friend, living in Rome at the time, had no need for this and decided to sell it.

As I was visiting my friend at the time of the property transfer, I went along to the formal notary session where the deed changes hands. Just for moral support, he still was a bit heartbroken over the loss of his dad.

So we come to the part where the actual payment and transfer take place. The notary excuses himself and goes off to the bathroom. The buyer hands my friend a plastic bag containing 95,500,000 (ninety five point five million) Lire, in fairly large bills. This was the purchase price agreed upon. The money is counted. Some henchman goes to find the notary.

The act of sale is passed, and *surprise* the lucky new owner says he payed 25 million Lire for the apartment. The notary duly puts this amount on the sales act, and everyone is happy. So the new owner will be paying property tax on about a quarter of the actual value of the property, for as long as he holds on to it.

And these were not ""wise guys"". Just to perfectly amicable and normal Italian gentlemen doing business with each other. They didn't even have to pay off the notary, my friend told me, as this practice is so common everybody expects everyone else to co-operate smoothly.

"""LIBERAL PC ORTHODOXY"" IS ONE OF THOSE PHRASES YOU REALLY ONLY SEE SHOW UP ON WHITE NATIONALIST SCREEDS",['bushiz'],0,"Disclaimer: I'm rather opposed to SRS, fairly neutral about MR (and I don't really post there, so I don't know much of the inside culture).

SRS is a subreddit founded by /u/reddit_sux, it used to be mainly about showing how racist Reddit is, by picking quotes from Reddit and StormFront and asking people to determine which quote's from where. The subreddit wasn't particularly popular, and eventually redditsux left for other sites. 

Meanwhile over at Something Awful (a site once dedicated to shock humor which somehow devolved into a liberal circlejerk with ideology and atmosphere very similar to the current SRS), someone noticed Reddit, and started a huge topic about ""Shit Reddit Says"", basically the predecessor to SRS. The topic became popular, and /r/ShitRedditSays revitalized (many of the SRS mods and early arrivals are also SA users, and the culture/memes are very much SA). This was around the time /r/jailbait was closed down, and many feel SRS/SA had a significant role to play in that happening.

**This paragraph is just my personal opinion:** Now, SRS is mainly a circlejerk (but I wouldn't say a troll, the people there by and large tend to believe the shit they spew, though they might exaggerate it from time to time) dedicated to finding anything that conflicts with liberal PC orthodoxy, be that a joke or a true prejudiced comment, as seen from the perspective of a freshman Women Studies major. The majority of SRSers are white, male, straight, atheist, etc. but that doesn't stop them from telling Reddit what minorities believe.

/r/MensRights is basically a subreddit for the Men's Rights movement, which is about as diverse as feminism, so you've got everyone from bitter exes, to forever alone types who can't get laid, to Average Joes who believe that women are gaining rights at the expense of men (or at least are apathetic to them). Quite a few of them are opposed to feminism in general, while some are fine with it, but want it to be more egalitarian and focused on the plights of both men and women.

This often conflicts with SRS's philosophy that men are privileged (they get advantages in society that women don't), and that the most important thing is to give women all the rights men have, and sometimes more (to make up for past injustices/inequalities). They don't get along at all.

Recently an [SRSer with connections](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/sfieu/why_the_fuck_and_on_what_grounds_was_rmensrights/c4dn92z) convinced the Southern Poverty Law Center to include /r/mensrights in an article about how Men's Rights groups in general are misogynistic, and SRS in general went with the (incorrect) line that the SPLC labeled /r/mensrights as a hate group.",51,51,smooshie,0,-15

Sorry but I don't believe that it's ever a good idea to date a raped woman. They're filled with too many psychological issues to be decent partners.,['SlayersEveHymen'],0,"My ex and her 3 siblings were constantly raped from an incredibly young age. Their mother left when she was about 3 because their father was massively abusive, and the last straw was he threw her through a window out onto the front lawn.

The kids stayed with him until my ex was the age of 10 or 11. Apparently he would rape them, and a few other men. There was one man that they were made to call uncle that was particularly brutal, and my ex was the one he took most of the time. She usually took the brunt of the abuse because she tried to protect her siblings, and this started her penchant for lying. She would lie if one of them did something and would take the blame.

So, she would be brutally raped from a young age. She was also forced to have sex with her brother. Her father's sister worked at DoCS (child protective services in Australia), and helped him whenever a complaint was made by anyone about anything. Apart from the rape, he would make her eat rotten meat, and if she threw up, he would make her eat that. She has a phobia of spiders because he used to raise spiders or something in a large fishtank, which he threw onto her to make her not scream when she saw a spider.

The other kids sort of glossed it all over and try to forget about it, but she doesn't and would constantly bring it up. I knew her from high school, and never knew any of this until we started dating a few years ago.

I was comforting to her, and according to her and her entire family, I am the only person that she has been with that has never hit her and we worked on our relationship to the point where she was comfortable with me to do anything sexual that either of us agreed to. It was good.

Then she decided to start going to counselling after she had a flashback one night to her father holding a gun to her head, and then the man who used to rape her constantly confronted her and said hello in an alleyway that lead to where her car was parked.

After the first session, she changed. She couldn't sleep without some form of light being on. She began smoking pot to the point where all of our money went on it. She began cheating on me. She would lie through her teeth about everything. I even found out she began stripping and prostituting herself to get enough money to get drugs.

By this time, we have a son together, and I am always left with him, my own twin boys and her son from a previous relationship. She doesn't come home until shit hours in the morning, is always sleepy in the day. I tried to stick with her and would try to help her quit the drugs, but she says it is the only thing that helps her not hurt and feel numb. I am so drained all the time from never sleeping, and always taking care of the kids that I started getting angry at her all the time and when she would snap at me, I would yell. I have never and will never hit a woman, but I can be scary when I yell. It did not help that she would threaten to kill me when she couldn't get any drugs.

Finally we broke up earlier this year. Finding out that she had cheated on me was the final straw. She was telling people we had broken up months prior, and she would refer to me as her babysitter. I had become the glorified babysitter for the girl I absolutely loved whilst she would go out and get fucked by random guys so she could get money to pay for drugs.

**TL;DR My ex and her siblings were raped. A flashback and counselling to help resolve those issues totally destroyed our relationship (ie. she cheated, did drugs, lied, stripping, prostituting) which had been great beforehand.**

So, what are my thoughts about what my ex had told me about her experience with rape? My first thought was poor thing. My second thought was what the fuck is wrong with someone that they could rape someone, especially a child, let alone their child.

My third thought was that I was going to be the best fucking guy to this girl on earth. I tried my best, but her past caught up to her and couldn't let us be happy.

"The article is fairly poorly written, but here's what appears to have happened:

* The government carried out a warrant to seize *some* of the data off of Megaupload's servers and froze Megaupload's accounts due to the criminal charges it brought against Megaupload

* The remaining data stayed on Carpathia's (Megaupload's data hoster) servers, and soon after the initial seizure the government said it didn't need anything else and Carpathia was free to do what it wanted with the data

* Carpathia started saying it wanted to delete the data since Megaupload to could no longer pay its bills

So there's two possible cases for the individual suing:

* his data was amongst the data seized by the government, in which case he's suing the right people and has every right to reclaim his property (although typically not until after the trial, as it's being used as evidence, although since this is digital they could probably just make a copy (hah, ironic)).

* his data is not amongst the data seized, in which case it is still residing on Carpathia's servers, and he *is* suing the wrong people, which is why the DOJ is making the statements that it is. If the government never took the data, and the plaintiff wins, then he would effectively be getting the government to pay for Megaupload's data hosting (Carpathia would likely demand payment to retrieve the data). The reason they're saying it's a bad precedent is that it *would* be setting a bad precedent, by making the government financially responsible for any debts or property loss indirectly brought about due to the arrest of criminals (whether or not Megaupload is or is not guilty is immaterial to this specific issue).

To use the often referred to real life storage locker analogy, this is like the government arresting the owner of a physical storage locker but saying they could care less about the storage property or its contents, and then getting sued and forced to pay to allow all of the man's customers to get their stuff back.",['[deleted]'],0,"Not one bit of that makes the least bit of sense.

&gt;""Mr. Goodwin's proposed solution is to have the government bear the financial cost of restoring his data,"" the U.S. Attorney's office wrote in its filing, ""even if that means releasing assets of the defendants which are subject to mandatory forfeiture. Twenty-three years ago, the Supreme Court made clear that a criminal defendant does not have a right to use someone else's money to finance his defense."" 

Um......what?  

&gt;Finally, the government said if the court grants Goodwin's request, it would open the door for any third party to petition the courts any time a search warrant affects them adversely. 

Again.....what?  If I'm negatively affected by a search warrant that has nothing else to do with me, I'm supposed to just suck it up and take it?  

I believe DotCom is nothing but a sleazeball who was knowingly profiting off of piracy.  But that doesn't mean I agree with the way that the US government has handled this case at all.  The guy might be a sleazeball, and I believe he's 100% guilty.  But he's still got the right to a fair trial.

The 5 stages of loss end with acceptance. Not the acceptance of his sexuality, again, this is about you, but the acceptance of the new friend that you will become for him.

He chose you because he trusts you so give yourself some credit.

I was (still am) a friend to one of these girls when the ""shit hit the fan"" and I saw the whole thing unfold. She is like a sister to me today and I truly love her. 
What I can tell you is that things will turn out fine, things will be different but a lot of times different means better.
He will find a way to finally tell his wife and they will deal with it.
He will decide what he wants to do about his career. 
He will have to deal with coming out to his family and his friends and his community... and that will be fine too, in the long run. 
People have their own timing, not cool to see other Redditors here saying that he should have came out when he was a teen and that he should not have married, etc., ( you guys should not be judgmental!)
Anyway, in a nutshell, do not disregard your own emotions and please share them with your friend. He will help you help him and that is the best way to be the best friend one can be.

BAD LUCK BRIAN DOES IT AGAIN! HTTP://WWW.QUICKMEME.COM/MEME/3OR489/,['acephreak'],0,"Your submission was removed from IAmA. IAmA's should focus on something uncommon that plays a central role in your life or a truly unique and interesting event. Your AMA would be better suited for [/r/CasualIAmA](/r/CasualIAmA)!

**Edit:**

I can see that you’re all unhappy about BLB’s IAmA being removed; the many courteous and polite replies have made that clear. Unfortunately, in delineating what a subreddit is for, sometimes popular content gets moved elsewhere. IAmA itself came about because they were removed from /r/AskReddit despite being very popular there. Being removed doesn’t make the content bad, it just makes the content in the wrong place. He’s welcome to post it in /r/CasualIAmA (as I suggested), or somewhere more relevant like /r/adviceanimals. 

So, why doesn’t this fit within IAmA’s guidelines?

Well, first it isn't an ""event"". That part of the rule is there to allow something like ""I was at woodstock"" while disallowing something like ""I farted"".

Second: it's not particularly unique. There are new ""memes"" every day, and growing. And it isn’t just meme pics that we allowed; viral videos, popular gimmicks, etc. Where’s the line between “A photo of me is on the top of /r/adviceanimals"" (which would seemingly be allowed) and ""A video of me is on the top of /r/videos""? Is that allowed? And if you allow that, why not ""My question is at the top of askreddit""? There would be a very low standard of what our subreddit was for; seeming ly anything on the front page would be worthy of an IAmA. 

And third, we should look at what IAmA was for. It was supposed to be about Redditors being able to share their experiences from **outside of Reddit** and the internet. It's about what they do with their lives. That's not the situation we have here. The actual ""bad luck brian"" person has nothing to do with the meme. Again, that's why the ridiculously photogenic guy one was different: this had led to a huge media blitz for him, to the point where his life has been significantly impacted. In this very thread, Bad Luck Brian said that it hadn't really affected his life at all.

 *Back in my day* we actually had fun in college. I remember one time when me and my frat brothers were bored and decided to shoot bow and arrows off the top of our house. At first we set up targets in the back yard and shot the arrows at them. It was entertaining for a while but it lost its allure after the third or forth time we did it. The bow and arrow was sort of lost and forgotten for a time.
 
Fast forward a year later, our fraternity was having a cowboys and Indians themed party when, in my drunken stupor, i had a illuminating epiphany that i could scare the cowboys with the glory that was my bow. But i couldn't just shoot arrows, that would be too mundane, so i thought ""what if i lit the arrows on *fire*!"" (brilliant as i was in my teenage years). So i got a handkerchief, wrapped it around my arrowhead, dipped it in kerosene and clambered up to the roof. I saw one of my buddies in the front lawn shooting off pistols in the front yard and let out my most magnificent ""*OU-UOU-UOUOO-OUOU-OU-UOO*"" and fired off the arrow, well as it turns out I didn't have the most impeccable aim due to my current mental state and completely missed him. I did however manage to hit a bush right next to our front porch, which promply set the porch on fire. Needless to say the fire department was called and our deck: destroyed.

I offered some of my burger to him and he finished it off for me. I felt a little bad guess he didn't have much money, I would have gladly paid for my own way. Then the conversation turned to sex.

He slammed his slobbering tongue in my mouth and starts whirling it around. His hot breath smelled of burgers. I pulled away and ask to be taken home. He takes me home, chit chatting like nothing happened and still about sex and other inappropriate topics. When we got home he asked me to call him later and I didn't. ",451,451,StegaSarahs,0,169

too bad he has aids,['[deleted]'],0,"When presented with a similar circumstance in elementary school I wrote to John Travolta. I had just seen the film ""Michael"" where he's an angel-on-earth that Wikipedia describes as a ""boozing, smoking, oversexed slob"". Well, I thought he was the coolest motherfucker on the planet (or the heavens!). Meanwhile, another classmate who had slacked on this-of-all projects, asked me who I was writing to, and then proceeded to ""copy"" me. Privately, it set me on fire. I couldn't bear the thought of this kid getting a better response than I, from my hero! From Michael, the winged alcoholic with a heart of gold! So I wrote John multiple pages (it was longest paper I wrote until deep into high school) praising his work and requesting various things from him: photos, autographs, clippings, interviews, personal things he could throw my way. I asked him advice, shared stories, etc. In hindsight, it was over-the-top ridiculous. My teacher laughed out loud when he read it but then insisted I send it to see what kind of response I would get back. My classmate received his response first, a small photograph with ""John Travolta"" on it. Exactly what he had requested. 

A couple days later my package arrived. I received a very large glossy photograph of John, with something along the lines of ""To (my name) for the wonderful words, stories, etc. - John Travolta"". With the photograph was a letter from his wife reiterating how much they had appreciated the letter, what it meant to John, some specifics about my letter, etc. I was the the happiest kid alive. It made me feel like the world was a lot smaller and more accessible than I had thought. I've been cheering on Travolta ever since. ",1281,1281,northern_thorn,0,-8

LOL, WHAT KIND OF SHIT IS THAT?  IS THAT HOW YOU THINK SCIENCE WORKS?  YOU CAN JUST EXAMINE ONE SIDE OF AN ISSUE, TOTALLY IGNORE THE OTHER SIDE, AND THEN CLAIM THAT YOU HAVE LEGIT SCIENTIFIC FINDINGS.

AM I THE ONLY ONE THAT THINKS THIS IS RETARDED?  IF THE EPA WANTS TO MAKE A CLAIM OF ""SCIENTIFIC FINDINGS"" IT IS ON THEM TO DO SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH REQUIRED TO MAKE THIS CLAIM, NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

&GT;IT SEEMS YOU WOULD LIKE TO THROW THIS OUT ON A TECHNICALITY, 

I'D SAY THAT TOTALLY IGNORING ONE SIDE OF THE ISSUE (WHICH NOBODY CAN ARGUE THAT THEY DIDN'T) IS HARDLY A TECHNICALITY.  THE FACT THAT YOU THINK IT IS CALLS INTO QUESTION YOUR RATIONAL THINKING ABILITIES.

&GT;HOWEVER THERE IS TOO MUCH AT STAKE TO GO AGAINST THE SCIENTIFIC CONSENSUS WITHOUT ACTUAL EVIDENCE THAT THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OUTWEIGH THE COSTS AND DRAWBACKS.

IF THAT IS YOUR STANCE, THEN FINE.  IN REALITY, I ACTUALLY PRETTY MUCH AGREE WITH THIS IDEA.  HOWEVER, THIS IDEA DOES NOT SERVE AS A LEGAL BASIS FOR THE EPA TO ENACT REGULATIONS.  

IN ORDER FOR THE EPA TO LEGALLY ENACT REGULATIONS, THEY MUST PROVE THAT IT HAS A NET NEGATIVE EFFECT ON HUMAN HEALTH.

THEY CAN'T DO THIS LOOKING AT ONLY HALF THE EQUATION.

IF THEY ATTEMPT TO, THEIR FINDINGS SHOULD BE REJECTED AS ANYTHING ""SCIENTIFIC"".

&GT;WHEN PUBLIC SAFETY IS CONCERNED, IT IS BETTER TO ERR ON THE SIDE OF CAUTION.

When I first got my puppy, Phineas, my friend had rescued him and his whole litter from a kill-shelter in Kentucky. (I live in New Jersey). Unfortunately, they had [Parvo](http://pets.webmd.com/dogs/parvo-parvovirus-dogs) virus.

The rest of his siblings did not make it, but Phinny fought his hardest. He was in quarantine at the vet for almost 2 weeks when we came to the end. The vet gave us one additional option - a blood transfusion. It was certainly not a guarantee, but it was one last option before there was nothing left. His vitals were dropping, he couldn't stand on his own, he was just a lump of bone and fur.

As my fiance and I were discussing it, Phin climbed into my lap. A dog that couldn't hold his own 4 lb weight, used whatever energy he had in him to climb into my lap and lick my hand. There was no other option at that point. He received the blood from his donor dog and within hours his coat went from dull to shiny, he was standing little by little, and he was finally keeping food down.

Without this donor blood, I would not have my best friend here with me today. So thank you and thank Mac for this amazing sacrifice.
