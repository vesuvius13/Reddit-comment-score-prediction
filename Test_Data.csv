this obviously requires a full story,['trose89'],0,"I once dropped acid right after school on a Friday. Went home to quickly get ready to go out when my mom said ""ok you ready to go"". To which I replied ""huh"". ""We are going to get you fitted for your tux, for your brothers wedding"". Needless to say; it was an adventure.


Alright; story.  I was in grade 9 and had this class called “Spartacus”, it was a fitness class that you would weight lift then run 3 km. I put the tab (only 1; I was in grade 9, later in life 5 strips became the norm) in my mouth before the run. By the time the run was over and I walked home I was peaking huge.  So I get in the car with my mom and the world around me is breathing. I try to make regular conversation about her work and my brother s wedding; “how was your day”, “is everything ready for the wedding” etc., looking for her to talk and me to not be stupid.  I am a pretty talkative extrovert, so while walking through the mall and my mom notice I am not talking is a situation.  I have to say “oh I am just tired from the week and Spartacus”. But really the walls are flowing and the people are all waving and looking at me like they know.  Getting the tux on was like taking a straitjacket off; lucky I have never put one on and I am 15 so I can play stupid. But I am telling you it was scary being stuck in a room by yourself with a mirror (which we all know is the worst thing while hallucinating)  and clothes you have no idea what to do with.  The tailor came in and basically dressed me. Holding back the laughter was the hardest thing I have ever done.  It all gets done and we leave; I am so relieved and just hope we can go home and I can leave. But of course I have to eat dinner with my parents at home now. Eating and acid doesn’t mix. I literally have to force food down my throat. The whole time trying not to giggle or freak out, both possibilities. I am finally able to leave, the relief was unbelievable.

As meth became more refined, it became known as crystal or glass. 'Dope' is considered an insult to a dealer that is proud of the quality of his glass. If you ask a guy for some meth, he will think that you're a cop. These days in the Southwest, asking for dope will generally be followed up with the question, ""Yay or chrys?"" A negative shake of your head will bring a nod from the guy who will then, if he's holding H, hook you up. 

When someone new comes around and asks about dope, there is generally a brief pause while we try to sort out just what they mean. It's a vague word used ambiguously by those with only amateur knowledge of illicit substances.

Romney didn't win a single age group. Paul repeated his victory with under 30s from NH; everyone older went Gingrich.

Education level made startlingly little difference for Paul voters (12%, 15%, 13%, 11%) and Santorum voters (18%, 18%, 16%, 15%). Romney won postgrads, Gingrich college grads and lower.

Romney won amongst $200k and higher. Gingrich was pretty consistent (37%, 42%, 42%, 40%) amongst the groups below that. Paul lost votes as people got more wealthy (18%, 16%, 13%, 11%, 6%, similar to the 35%, 28%, 22%, 20%, 12% trendline from NH). Santorum was fairly constant.

57% of the primary thought the deficit was more important than jobs. That's not representative of... well, any national poll I can think of (though maybe it's switched in the last couple of months), so the candidate that comes out of that environment won't be an ideal general election candidate.

13% think Paul ran the most unfair campaign. This makes me wonder if these people understand the meaning of the word ""unfair"".

Brain size correlates with IQ:

[Evolution, brain size, and the national IQ of peoples around 3000 years B.C](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886909003675) (2010)

&gt; Multivariate Cholesky decompositions were performed with each brain volume measure entered first, followed by the four cognitive measures. Consistent with previous research, each brain and cognitive measure was found to be significantly heritable. The novel finding was the significant genetic but not environmental **covariance between brain volumes and cognitive measures.** Specifically, PIQ shared significant common genetic variance with all four measures of brain volume (r g = .58–.82). In contrast, VIQ shared significant genetic influence with neocortex volume only (r g = .58). Processing speed was significant with total brain volume (r g = .79), neocortex (r g = .64), and white matter (r g = .89), but not prefrontal cortex. The only brain measure to share genetic influence with reading was total brain volume (r g = .32), which also shared genetic influences with processing speed.

&gt; In differential psychology there has been a tradition of seeking fundamental parameters of cognitive processing or single biological variables that might account for intelligence differences. The results have been sparse, but two biological findings have persisted and accumulated: general intelligence differences are substantially heritable; and **general intelligence and brain size show modest, positive correlations.**

Wikipedia: [Neanderthals in popular culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neanderthals_in_popular_culture)

&gt; Although they are frequently characterized in an unflattering manner, research showing Neanderthals were as intelligent as contemporaneous Homo sapiens, with early stone tool technologies of comparable efficiency, is debunking long-held beliefs.

[Source](http://isteve.blogspot.com/2012/02/maybe-weve-got-this-whole-neanderthal.html) *(Note: Steve Sailer is [widely considered to be a racist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Sailer#Views_and_criticism), but in this particular instance he's not saying anything technically false)*
",['Offended_Neanderthal'],0,"The Neanderthal thing is a myth. It was a 19th Century assumption that Neanderthal died out because of inferior intelligence. That's radically shifted. Likewise with the theory that he couldn't talk. We now know because of skeletal recreations via computer and DNA tests (showing that they had the Fox P2 gene) that Neanderthal could talk. He also had a concept of the Afterlife, musical instruments and there's evidence that he smelted metal thousands of years before modern man came upon the technology. (A Neanderthal site was discovered where they were chasing the woolly rhino. Nearby were copper tools. Modern man didn't learn to smelt copper until 4,500 BC. The Neanderthal tools were from 100,000 years before that.) Along those lines a recent study concluded that, in comparing tools from both human and Neanderthal communities, that the Neanderthal tools were every bit as good as modern man's, and in some cases even better. (You can read more here: http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/08/080825203924.htm)

So the old myth of ""Neanderthal dying out because of inferior intelligence"" has been debunked to all hell.

(Up until very recently, Neanderthal didn't fit well into the Darwinian scheme of things. We're supposed to be the apex of all evolution; so everything before us *must* have been inferior . . . or so the reasoning goes. So a grossly inaccurate portrait of Neanderthal was created by 19th Century Darwinists, bent on making him ""inferior"". Racist impulses even colored their pictures, with early representations presenting him as having a prognathous jaw, dark skin and Negroid features. We now know that he had the genes for freckles, blue eyes and red hair. And in computer reconstructions, what do you know: the prognathous jaws magically disappeared when you took out the ""artist's conception"" of what Neanderthal was *supposed* to look like.)

You can see the computer version here: http://www.trussel.com/prehist/recon.jpg

In the 19th Century, they would actually misalign the jaws to make them look more apelike and (in that racist time-period) more Negroid. Giving representations like this: https://c479107.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/files/12038/area14mp/hfhm79qb-1340258863.jpg

At last, we're moving away from those unenlightened times and presenting Neanderthal remains more in line with their actual DNA and skeletal structures, so that modern reconstructions look like this: http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/09/images/080917-neanderthal-photo_big.jpg

And, as you point out, Neanderthal's cranial capacity was larger than modern man's. Here are the two skulls side-by-side: http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_0yhVo-TfeQg/Sar4w5Cxt6I/AAAAAAAABlM/4NW7TfNiaak/s400/0_64_080317_neanderthal.jpg

(The modern theory is no longer than we out-thought him [because we patently didn't] but that we outbred him.)

Especially after genetic evidence has concluded that Neanderthal DNA has been found in Europeans. It's an old theory that goes back to anthropologist Carleton Coon. In digging up skeletal remains all over the world, he noticed that racial differences seemed to coincide with pre-existing proto-hominid populations. In other words, we didn't get ""racial traits"" from evolution, but through cross-breeding. He advanced this theory based on the rapid changes he was seeing in the skulls and skeletons. It wasn't the tens of thousands of years that evolution required, but rapid morphological changes after the two populations would interact. For instance, remember when I said that Neanderthal had the genes for red hair, blue eyes and freckles?

Let's look at a map of where Neanderthals lived: http://www.zafarrayaneanderthal.com/neanderthalrange.gif

Note that modern humans who have these traits overlap *exactly* where Neanderthal lived.

Where Neanderthal didn't live, we don't see people with red hair, blue eyes and freckles.

But it's deeper than that. Coon pointed out skull features (like the occipital bun, that Neanderthal had . . . as well as modern Basques and Scandinavian populations), as well as certain hand bones and dentition. In any case, the larger scientific community was resistant to the cross-breeding theory . . . until about 5 years ago, when DNA vindicated him.

There *had* been cross-breeding.

So Europeans may have larger skulls because of Neanderthal admixture. (The same place they got a lot of other traits that Neanderthal had.)

The same DNA tests that detected Neanderthal DNA in Caucasoids did NOT detect it in sub-Saharan Africans.

That would make sense, according to Coon, since their ""racial traits"" are related to another proto-hominid: Homo erecutus.

Consider what Homo erectus looked like: http://genealogyreligion.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Homo-Erectus-4.jpg

And then consider what Neanderthal looked like: http://metamedia.stanford.edu/imagebin/happy-neanderthal.jpg

There's evidence, too, that Southeast Asians shrank because of cross-breeding with Homo florensis [the so-called Hobbit Man]. And Siberians probably bred with Denisovans.

All these proto-hominids affected what modern populations look like, what their cranial capacity and skull-shapes look like.

* I've gotten far afield. Sorry. As for a recent study on brain size and intelligence, the University of Ontario compared men and women who took the SATs. The men, on average, had 100 grams more of gray matter. They also statistically scored about 3.5 IQ points higher than their female counterparts. Though the media played this up as a gender issue, it has more to do with cranial capacity.

FROZEN VEGGIES STAY EDIBLE FOR A PRETTY LONG TIME TOO, THEY'RE BETTER THAN CANNED, AND CHEAPER AND MORE CONVENIENT THAN FRESH. THE ONLY TIME WE BUY FRESH PRODUCE IS IF IT'S SOMETHING WE'RE GOING TO BE NEEDING FOR THAT NIGHT. YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT TAKES ME TO GO SHOPPING FOR FRESH PRODUCE? ABOUT 5 MINUTES. SOMEONE STOPS AT THE STORE ON THE WAY HOME, GOES IN, GETS WHAT'S NEEDED AND GETS THE FUCK OUT. HELL, IF YOU HAVE A 24 HOUR STORE TO GO TO IT CAN ACTUALLY BE A PRETTY FUN ADVENTURE IF YOU'RE DRINKING OR SMOKING ON A WEEKEND NIGHT.

AND VARIETY ISN'T REALLY AN ISSUE IF YOU COOK YOURSELF PROPER PORTIONS. IF A RECIPE CALLS FOR X AMOUNT OF WHATEVER AND IT SAYS IT MAKES 2-4 SERVINGS, CUT IT ALL IN HALF AND MAKE 1-2 SERVINGS INSTEAD. THAT'S HOW RECIPES WORK, AND YOU'LL LEARN MORE ABOUT COOKING AT THE SAME TIME. IT'S EASIER TO TELL WHAT YOU'RE USING TOO MUCH OF IN SMALL BATCHES OF THINGS RATHER THAN LARGE. TASTES WILL STAND OUT MORE SINCE THERE'S LESS THEY'RE MIXING IN WITH.

GO AHEAD AND EAT BIGMACS, I DON'T CARE. IT'S PRETTY SAD THOUGH WHEN PEOPLE JUSTIFY EATING FAST FOOD OR TAKE OUT ALL THE TIME BECAUSE THEY SAY THEY'RE HORRIBLE AT COOKING (PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE IS HORRIBLE AT COOKING WHEN THEY FIRST START - IT'S JUST SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO DO LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE) OR THAT IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE (WHOLE CHICKEN = $6, YOU CAN MAKE YOURSELF LUNCH AND DINNER FOR 2 DAYS AT $1.50 A POP) OR IT TAKES TOO LONG (SAME CHICKEN TAKES ABOUT 10 MINUTES OF PREP TIME, 20 MINUTES OF BAKING AND ANOTHER 10-15 OF BROILING - THE LAST TWO STEPS YOU NEED TO PAY ALMOST ZERO ATTENTION TO ONCE YOU LEARN YOUR OVEN).

I'D RATHER EAT A NICELY COOKED CHICKEN FOR LUNCH AND DINNER WITH A LITTLE HOMEMADE SALAD -- BUY ABOUT 5 DOLLARS OF ONIONS, PEPPERS, TOMATOES AND WHATEVER ELSE YOU WANT TO TOSS IN WITH THE LETTUCE, THROW IT IN THE FRIDGE AND EAT SALAD WITH EVERY LUNCH AND DINNER FOR A WEEK. HEY, LOOK, YOU HAVE A REALLY EASY TO MAKE, HEALTHY, FILLING AND DELICIOUS MEAL FOR A FEW DAYS.

OR YOU CAN HAVE A WHOPPER AND SHAKE.

I'M SORRY IF THIS COMES OFF AS VERY CONDESCENDING, BUT I JUST THINK IT'S REALLY, REALLY SAD HOW FEW PEOPLE ARE CAPABLE OF COOKING MEALS FOR THEMSELVES AND CONSIDER THEMSELVES ADULTS. THESE ARE TYPICALLY THE SAME PEOPLE WHOSE PLACES I GO OVER AND THERE IS A SINK FULL OF DIRTY DISHES, THE CARPETS OR FLOORS ARE FILTHY, UNWASHED LAUNDRY ALL OVER THE PLACE AND OTHER THINGS WHICH INDICATE THAT THAT PERSON IS COMPLETELY INCAPABLE OF TAKING CARE OF THEMSELVES.

IT'S NOT THAT HARD IF YOU PUT IN A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT; TRY TO ACT LIKE AN ADULT.",['[deleted]'],0,"&gt; it's a hell of a lot cheaper, better tasting and better for you


Er, no, it **can be** if you want it to be (and know how to make it be), but it can also be a hell of a lot more expensive, worse tasting, and worse for you.

Just because you're cooking for yourself doesn't mean you're eating some super cheap amazing diet food.  Just because you're eating out doesn't mean you're eating a tripple baconator with a chocolate frosty.

I find that when I'm cooking, it undoubtedly tastes worse because, well, I suck at cooking.

As for price.. it depends on what I'm buying, and how long it lasts.  Because I live alone, I often have to choose between eating the same thing multiple nights in a row, or wasting a good chunk because I don't finish it before it gets bad.  This makes it a lot less cost efficient than it could be.   In the end I'd say eating out is still more expensive for me, but I don't think it has to be.  You can get out of a fast food place spending maybe $2 if you wanted to,  but in a grocery store I don't really know what I could eat for $2. It likely wouldn't be very healthy, as fresh produce is *expensive*.

Another factor for me is variety. Again, cooking means eating the same or similar things multiple times, as its hard to scale down for one person. And planning ahead so you have the ingredients needed on hand, or going shopping every day.  Eating out means I can pick whatever I want from wherever I want.  A lot more convenient.

WAS NOT EXPECTING THAT TO END THE WAY IT DID.,['Thom0'],0,"HA! This reminds me of the first time I played Minecraft. Me and my sister were sitting in the living room watching TV when my mom comes in with the mail and hands it out to us. She gave me my GameInformer and my sister got her Seventeen magazine. In the GameInformer there was a brief article about Minecraft, so I thought I would try it out. I got on the computer and played the free trial. I had tons of fun, so I asked my mom if I could buy it with her credit card as long as I pay her back. So I got the full game and spent the next few weeks building crappy little houses and stuff.

One day, my mom got her credit card bill. On it were charges from some very, *very* hardcore porno sites. It must have been my sister, but she thought it was me because she gave me her credit card. She was understandably upset and I was grounded for months and sent to see a psychologist.

Spending months with the psychologist to find out why I had these strange sexual desires, we made a ""breakthrough"". The quack told me I was sexually attracted to my sister, and I was going to have to confront that by making her as undesirable as possible. All I thought was ""Yeah cool well it's been an hour so I gotta go."" But on the way home I was thinking about what he said, and realized he was right. He was absolutely right. I was sexually attracted to my sister.

I got home and went up to her room. I knocked on the door and asked if I could come in. She let me enter and I closed the door behind me. I told her about the breakthrough, and she said she felt the exact same way about me. We talked it over and finally agreed to do it.

She started by taking off my shirt, then she got out a pair of scissors and cut a pentagram into my shirt, held it into the air and chanted ""Lord Satan, give my brother erectile dysfunction so that he may never spill his seed inside of me."" So my innocent decision to try out Minecraft is how I got erectile dysfunction.",1220,1220,JumboPatties,0

It's the difference between 'I think you're a failure' and 'I think you can do better'. Note the former is undeniably negative (implying one should not even try)  while the latter has a decidedly positive connotation, implying one is perfectly capable of impressing, if they only put forth the effort.

Without getting too much into the subject: most people are terrified of upsetting other people. Certain demographics, such as attractive women, go about their daily lives almost entirely unchallenged socially. By questioning someone's taste in something so mundane and unimportant as say, footwear, you demonstrate yourself to be, at the very least, different--and therefore interesting.

If your best friend wore ugly shoes, you'd point them out, cock an eyebrow, and ask 'Really?'. This is a natural and friendly interaction, and most people wouldn't question it in any way. You'd probably get a laugh out of it together. For whatever reason, do the same thing to a woman you met recently, attach a silly name to the naturally occurring act and phenomenon, and it becomes manipulation that people get very upset about on the internet.

Basically: No one likes a kiss-ass. And some people's asses are well-kissed.

MOST COMBAT DEATHS ARE FROM SHRAPNEL AND DEBRIS FLUNG FROM EXPLOSIVES.",['Emberwake'],0,"Actually arrows can be extremely deadly against armored combatants. Bodkin arrows (sort of needle tips) are especially brutal because they can fit in between the gaps in the armor and can even sometimes pierce steel. What armor is supposed to be for is stopping cuts and to some degree crushing damage. A sword blow at full speed can easily break bones, something heavier like an ax or hammer could crush steel entirely. So I wouldn't say one type of combat is easier or harder necessarily, just a different strategy. 

You also have to consider the weight of a modern soldier's kit in regards to communication devices, extra weapons, ammo, lights, etc. They are carrying significantly heavier weapons, a real medieval sword, even the two handed claymores, weigh no more than 4 pounds and can be as light as 2.5 pounds. In hand to hand combat what matters more than protection is dexterity. Medieval sword fighters relied on their ability to move their feet quickly to win fights.

"&gt;The gun owning family has a much higher chance of them killing the adopted kid

That's my point. 

&gt;So to answer your question, the difference in terms of accidental deaths between a gun owning family and any other one is statistically negligible. Remember we are quite literally talking about something that is one in a million.

But are gun owning families more or less likely to experience a gun accident? 

",['Posts_Bad_Content'],0,"Given that about half the households in the USA have a gun in them, you will definitely be spitting into the wind trying to prevent all of them from adopting kids (and im sure an orphan would be unhappy about having half of their potential new families disqualified)


For comparison, 1,960 by motor vehicle accidents, 1210 by suffocation, 457 by fire, 739 by drowning, 134 died by accidental poisoning, 92 by falling, etc.

So, to be actually this concerned for the kids welfare, disqualify anyone with a car? Force them to install a safe to keep their bleach in? No houses with stairs, definitely no backyard pools?

The gun owning family has a much higher chance of them killing the adopted kid while driving them to school than any half baked concerns of gun accidents.

Edit: Gold? I was gonna say I'm speechless, but I've wanted to get this off my chest for a while.

There's this chick I follow on Facebook. I accidentally started following her because she has the same name of this girl I met and thought I was sending a friend request to her. She was only 14 when I started following her. As soon as I realized she wasn't the person I was meaning to follow I went to unfollow her. But then I realized this 14 year old girl was hilariously stupid. She didn't know why America would send a separate team from Georgia to the Olympics, she couldn't figure out why elevators had buttons for the floor she was already on, and many other things I just saw and laughed. Anyway I never stopped following her because she was such a big source of my morning laughs.

She got pregnant at 15 because she thought you couldn't get pregnant on the first time. She was sure that the 15 year old boy that got her pregnant was going to be a great daddy. Well the kid is 1 now and she always complains about him never being around and how he would rather stay at home bored than see his son and all the other crap any of us could have warned her about when she was certain she was going to be the one teenage mom whose baby daddy would actually hang around.

Anyway the reason I bring all that up is that through these 2 years I've followed this complete moron she has never written your when she meant you're. So if this person can get it right, then everyone can.

You are in a relationship with someone, but terrified of 'settling' in case you miss that big opportunity with that hotter, younger, better partner who could be just around the corner.

She gets bored waiting for you to make up your mind, and moves on. You rejoice in your singledom again for a while, but you're getting older.

You start another relationship, but still feel that nagging doubt that you're settling, and missing out on something. That relationship goes the same way. Meanwhile, you start attending other people's weddings and seeing more and more of your friends in love.

There's less and less people to go hang out with. All your friends are having children or renovating or wanting to spend time with their partners not you. The people in the bars and clubs seem so much younger, and you feel old. You can't party all night any more, and you overhear ""dirty old man"" more than once in the club from a flock of pretty young things.

Your career is taking off, and you have more money, but it feels ... a bit pointless. You come home to an empty house more nights than not. When you feel down or stressed or worried or sick, you have to deal with it yourself. If something good happens, you have to celebrate for yourself too, as your friends are busy with their own lifes.

Your girlfriends start getting younger. While the sex may be good, you start to feel performance anxiety, comparing yourself to all the hotter, younger, fitter guys she interacts with on a daily basis. Conversations are shallow, and you find you have little in common with them beyond bed. Sometimes, although you can't admit it to her, you'd like to just cuddle and go to sleep, or just have vanilla sex.

Your parents and other loved ones start to die. There's no one in your life who knows them quite like you apart from your siblings, and you watch your brother's wife rub his shoulders at the funeral. You watch your sister's kids give trembling eulogies to their grandparents then rush back to their parents for a hug. You shuffle your feet awkwardly, and see if your latest gf has replied to your message about the funeral yet.

You start getting sick, and slowing down with age. You retire from your job, and suddenly your social circle disappears. There's no kids to visit, no grandchildren to sit on your knee, no one to remind you to take your medicine. There's no one who remembers you in your young glory, and all people have to go on is what you are like right now. Old jokes and stories need too much explanation to bother retelling. 

You start to forget things, and hear voices when you're alone, but no one is there to notice. Eventually, you fall in the bathroom and hit your head, not coming too until it's dark. You've been laying there on the cold tiles for at least a day. You've soiled yourself, and your head seems to be bleeding. You try to remember what happened, but it's fuzzy. You try to crawl to the phone to call for an ambulance, but pass out again by the time you reach the bathroom door, and never wake up.

Two weeks later, your neighbours notice the smell coming from your place, and call the police. You body is found half chewed by your cat.

SIMPLE.",['cleslie92'],0,"I just wanted to give some insight into what happened in this case and what we're discussing moving forward.

Witch hunting is not what was initially going on with the original thread about Blizer leaving MYM.  We were not concerned with whether the allegation harmed Blizer.  The mod who made the decision was making a tough call in the middle of the night when not many of us were able to give good feedback.

From our perspective, we had a he-said, she-said situation going down that meant either the thread's title was misleading or that Wiliiam Turton was using a questionable source for the story.  In either case, someone is going to be harmed by the claims being made but the decision of ""what is true"" was very hard to decide.  So, KoreanTerran asked both parties for evidence.

KoreanTerran talked with Blizer and MYM's management and William Turton appropriately defended his source.  But we were still left unsure about what the truth was.  So, with the skeleton crew available, a call was made to remove the thread.  It was a tough call.  I would expect all tough calls to upset people, just as the call to leave this thread up is likely going to upset people.

Tough calls are tough for a reason. Parts of the community want us to keep the content reasonably accurate, especially when claims pop up to the contrary. They would argue that the community regularly upvotes drama for the sake of seeing more drama and so that would mislead many more people than should be misled.  On the other side of the coin, there are parts of the community that think we should trust the community and allow the community to decide what ""truth"" is.  These voices exist within the moderating team as well.

On the whole, I guess what I'm trying to say is while we make strange calls sometimes, we each try to do what we think is best for the subreddit. When situations get controversial, we try to do review what happened to see whether there isn't any lesson we can learn from the controversy.  That is happening right now as well.  Internally we have a discussion going about how we should be responding to claims made by journalists--a discussion we've never had before, especially in the context of witch hunting. 

I'm sorry to see William Turton deciding to leave the industry.  I hope we can learn from the experience that led to this and avoid repeating this situation moving forward.",119,119,BuckeyeSundae,0

* service personnel, unless on a specific exercise/duty, dont walk around armed, do you think this is the fucken movies or something.  
* live ammunition is only used in non-combat situations in very specific situations. Ammuntion on bases is kept very secure and issued on as needed basis.  Do you think you can go down to the base mess hall and have some eggs and live rounds?
* non-combatants like pyschs aren't like line grunts when it comes to weapons handling etc.  This guy would have received some basic weapons training before going into theatre, he aint exactly a Ranger.  He most certainly is NEVER going to be walking around armed.  

Here is your utterly stupid words back at you:

Service personnel (especially non-combatants like psychiatrists) are carrrying loaded weapons around a base with them.  When they hear bad news or hear something they disagree with everyone should be ready to pounce on them just in case they want to shoot people.  For all others a constant watch should be put on them just in case they use their loaded weapons in the event of bad news.

Our country was built on the principles of economic competition. After the birth of our nation, there weren't any huge entrenched corporations that could get away with anything they wanted. It truly was Tabula Rosa (for white people anyway). And on top of it, we had a government that was willing to break up companies that got too large. The reason it's failing now is because our leaders became influenced enough by campaign contributions so that the idea to break up a company is no longer an option. And like he said, there's no meaningful checks when a company reaches a certain size.

It shouldn't be that you either vote all liberal or all conservative. You should back the leaders that put the best interests of the nation first. Not all republicans are hyper religious zealots, and not all liberals are the saviors we believe them to be. I'll admit, I vote liberal far more than conservative. But I can also see that there is some merits to their arguments. Not the poor people deserve to be poor idea, that's garbage. But it does make sense that those without will probably work harder to get what they want given the opportunity. We've simply taken away those opportunities thanks to piss poor school systems and outsourcing jobs to china. 

Leaving comments like this, I feel, only serve to incite those on the other side. As a result, the divide widens and we get people like the TEA party who have sought refuge in the bosoms of the large corporations.

$50 a day is $1500 a month. I live in a middle European country and I make $1000 a month. $1500 is more than minimal wage in almost all European countries, including developed ones like the UK. Even if you're the middle class in countries like Germany, the UK, Italy you might find it hard to save $1500 a month.

Since I'll have the benefit of a civil engineering background in both agriculture and municipal systems, I'm going to start building the fuck out of stuff. First comes some fucking sewers. Most likely it will be a common spot where people will have to dump their shit and then it'll be hauled away and composted. Given enough time, and quantity to get the temp up, it makes pretty good fertilizer. That means more food for the little fucks and since we're not shitting in the water supply, stuff like cholera should drop off. I'd do water distribution like the Romans too; find myself a pretty lake high in the mountains and run a covered aqueduct down to town. Wells are pretty good too, now that we're not shitting on the ground, but you best believe that any water in the imperial palace gets boiled before it's used.

I'd implement new drainage and irrigation practices for my farmers too. Flood irrigation is cheap and in the absence of anything better, pretty effective. And given enough manpower, damming streams with earthen berms to make reservoirs is pretty straight forward too.

 I'll make my slaves and surfs build roads out of concrete, cause it's pretty easy to make if you can lay your hands on the stuff, with decent drainage. Now folks moving goods through my kingdom can do so at a much greater speed. Let’s me move my army around fast too.

So, now I’ve that I’ve got a prosperous kingdom, cause folk like trading there and my farmers are using good practices. Folk want to come there because there’s money and folk aren’t constantly sick. I’ll be able to use my immense tax revenues to sponsor really smart motherfuckers to do research. Try and get some folks from the Persia and China and shit to come over. Point them toward things like germ theory and gun powder. Maybe a little calculus if I can remember any of it.

Seems like a pretty good deal now eh? And I’ll make everybody, in every town I control do it. Now, when my armies wander up to the gates of a new town and say “Join the Great Kingdom of Dick or we’ll burn this motherfucker to the ground and eat your babies”, folk will be inclined to say “sure, we got nothing better to do”. If you surrender, I’ll appoint one of my dudes as governor but let the local king or whatever stays in power too, long as they listen to me. If you don’t surrender, it’s BBQ baby time.

 And so the empire will expand.

"I'M GLAD YOU WROTE THIS BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE WHENEVER SOMEONE SAYS WHY THEY HATED CATCHER IN THE RYE IT'S ALWAYS BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT HOLDEN WAS IMMATURE OR UNLIKABLE, WHICH IS A PRETTY SHALLOW REASON FOR DISCREDITING AN ENTIRE NOVEL. ",['sleepy55'],0,"The thing about *Catcher* that people invariably do not acknowledge when they are discussing Holden on /r/books is that there are **two different Holden Caulfields;** there is the Holden telling the story and the Holden about whom the story is being told. Holden has gone out west to stay with his brother after all of this madman stuff happened to him after he was kicked out of Pency and a year later he is sitting down to reflect, but also to tell the readers his story. Holden throughout the entirety of the book is reflecting on himself, the things that he did and the person that he was one year ago.

Holden isn't meant to be likeable, but that's not to say that he isn't loveable. Him sitting down one year later to tell us his story about misunderstanding what it meant to be a catcher in the rye and all, is redemptive. Holden is a character who is being consumed by his coming of age and it's a time in his life, a time in most of our lives when we aren't very likable people. I know I was as cantankerous of a 16 year old as they come and I'm sure many of you could say the same about yourselves. Unlike so many books *Catcher* isn't a book about someone you want to be like or someone you want to be with it's a book about someone you are, or someone you were. It's about protecting ourselves from the inexorable march into adulthood and the futility of that pursuit. If you are just reading *Catcher* and thinking about it within the context of the Holden about whom the story is being told it's a terribly sad story, but if you expand your reading to the Holden narrating I think, I hope, you might find something enjoyable about it. 

It takes a lot for this kid to sit down and tell us everything he went through, the stuff with Sunny, the questions he asks of the cab driver, the fact that when he goes to ""give someone a buzz"" he looks through his phone book and has nobody to call (it'd be like you scrolling through your cell phone contacts and realizing there is no one, not a single person on that list who wants to talk to you), Allie's death... these are really intimate things for Holden to just be sharing with us in conversation, and ultimately that's what *Catcher* is, a conversation and what's a conversation but a chance to crawl inside the head of someone else, for better or worse. The beauty of *Catcher* is that Holden has found a way to make us care (or at least give us the opportunity to care or not). Through creating this text and having this conversation with the reader he has found an audience, someone who will empathize with him; through text Holden has done what he couldn't get anyone to do while he was living the story he is now telling. That's why *Catcher* is worthwhile and beautiful and worth reading, it gives us an opportunity to empathize with Holden and it exemplifies the power of written language. 

**tl;dr There are two Holdens in *The Catcher in the Rye* and if you only read it thinking about one of them you're gonna have a bad time.**

Why the fuck should I have the movie I paid for ruined because you **had** to bring a fucking baby into the theater?

That being said, there's nothing wrong with hating entire demographics, so long as you treat individuals fairly. Racists are people who hate people because of their race. Since race has nothing to do with who you are as a person and doesn't determine you're actions, it's incompatible with treating individuals fairly.

People hate politicians, that's a huge group of people. They hate politicians as a group because politicians lie and manipulate. Being a politician tends to *require* and reinforce that behavior. There's nothing wrong with hating politicians as a group, so long as you give each individual politician a fair chance. The same can be said for: lawyers, marketers, and criminals.

I very much doubt you'd be all riled up if someone said they hate criminals, but all criminals are individuals. Overall, in general, as a group it's ok to hate criminals, so long as you don't treat them individually like murdering scumbags when they really just smoked a little pot.

My best friend and I met on the orientation for a year abroad in Spain. She was going to the south, and me to the north. I'll tell my story first because it's somewhat shorter. 


Basically, my host sister was made that I wouldn't get high with her, so she decided to make my life hell. She took photos of my underwear and posted them on her Twitter, made fun of me both to my face and to her friends (whom my host mother obliged me to hang out with), called me a slut, a stupid American, and various other names. It got to the point where I cried myself to sleep every night and panicked when I had to wake up in the morning. I was vomiting at school (we went to separate schools) at the thought of going home and seeing her. The atmosphere was so tense. Her mother started getting defensive after I contacted the company that had sent me to Spain to ask to be transferred to another family. They refused, as they sometimes worked in close contact with the mother for other programs and didn't want to lose her as a resource. Finally, after 3 months with no hope of being transferred to another family, I decided to return home. The day after the flight was booked, the company abruptly changed their minds and told me that I had a new host family ready to take me, but they wouldn't give me any additional information. I finally found out that the woman who would be taking me already had two small children and two additional host students in her apartment. I would be sleeping on the couch and likely caring for her children as she was a single mother. Also, she was my host mother's best friend. I said no thank you. The day I left for the airport, my host sister didn't even come out of her room to say bye to me. It was awful. 


My friend's story is much worse. Her first host family would vanish for days at a time. They hardly ever fed her, despite her known history of bulimia. The company refused for weeks to transfer her, saying that because of her history of mental illness, they couldn't possibly believe her story. Eventually, they caved and sent her to a new city to live with a single old woman. This crazy lady bought locks for her cabinets and her refrigerator, and told my friend that any of her food needed to be paid for. When my friend bought her own food, the woman raided her room while my friend was at school and locked the food away. In February or March, IIRC, they got into an argument over the food thing and the woman strangled her until she passed out on the bed.

Those EVIL theists!!,['saywhaaaat'],0,"years ago, i used to cash my paychecks and keep the money on me.  i was working a shit job at the time so it wasn't *that* much, but still.

i went to go see my girlfriend one friday night after getting paid.  we hung out, did our thing... had a good time.  everything was great until it was time to go.

i got in my car, started it up, and began driving like i normally would.  i noticed my internal lights were dimmer than they normally were.  i didn't think much of it.

a couple miles later, i noticed them getting dimmer, along with my headlights.  i was losing power in acceleration.  everything about my car was dying all at once.  

my alternator took a shit.  i was stranded on the side of the road at 2AM in the middle of nowhere.  to make a long story shorter than it could be, i ended up getting jumps by four different people; one of which confessed to have just stolen the truck.  wtf in itself.

i ended up getting about 10 blocks from my house when it died for the last time.  by now, the sun was coming up, i was super tired, and was in walking distance to my house.  i pushed the car into the closest parking lot and walked across the street to the convenience store.

inside, i grabbed myself some water and some cigarettes, paid, and left.

let the unlucky begin.

i was wearing some cargo shorts with pockets off on the side under the normal pockets.  when i wore these, i always put my wallet into the left side pocket.  i was about 3/4 of the way back to the house when my left hand grazed it just right for me to take notice that something was wrong.  my wallet wasn't there.

i threw down my water and *ran* as fast as i could.  i was living with my mom at the time.  i bolted ass inside, ran up the stairs, banged on her bedroom door and demanded her keys to her car to drive back.  

i got back to the station and frantically looked around.  i accused the clerks on duty of stealing my wallet.  i was confident i had left my wallet on the counter.  that was the only explanation.  i called the police and filed a report.  my wallet was gone along with my license, social security card, and full paycheck.  fffffffuuuuuuuuuuu

fast forward to sunday.  i'm sitting upstairs in my room, drowning my sorrows in porn when the doorbell rang.  i stopped fapping just in case and thought about everything bad that would make my raging teen hard-on subside.  

sure enough, my mom called me down.  i couldn't think of anyone that would be coming over as usually, anyone i knew would let their coming-over be known before doing so.  i ran *every* possibility through my head while walking down the stairs except the one that mattered most at the time.

he was an older, frail black gentleman with a fedora, kempt beard, and warm smile.  

""are you so-and-so?"", he asked?  

""yes sir, i am.  how may i help you?""  

""i found this in the parking lot up the road yesterday.  it belongs to you.  i came by yesterday, but no one was home.""

it was my wallet.  i opened it and nothing was missing.  all money inside.  license and s.s. card.  everything.  

i wrapped my arms around him in joy and picked him up, thanking him.

i pulled out $75 to give him what i felt was a due reward.  he declined and wished me a good day.  i wasn't having any part of that.  i insisted.

as i'm walking towards him with the money extended to him, telling him to take it, he kept assuring me it was mine, i should keep it, and to have a good day.

he got back into his vehicle, started the engine, mouthed 'may god bless you', smiled, and drove off.

i consider that to be the luckiest day of my life.",72,72,[deleted],0

We were on music tour with school and i was sharing a room with aforementioned friend, and another 2 who were both my best friends.

As soon as we got there the first friend (let's call him K), took over and laid down a load of rules. He got to shower first, choose the bed, etc. And he was the ""Alpha Male"".

Personally I wasnt going to fight because in chilled out but my other 2 friends (let's call them A &amp;amp; G) didn't like it and tried to argue with him but lost. 

So this arrangement when on for 3 days (the tour was 6). K called the shots when we were in our room. 

A &amp;amp; G were getting more and more annoyed with him but on the  4th evening we all had to pull together. Another group of boys from our school tried to get into our room and steal a load of our stuff. We barricaded the door - working together - until the teachers came. 

Then K announced he was no longer Alpha male but we were all equal.

That night he told us why he'd done it (to see our reactions - gauge our personalities) and we had a discussion that went on until 4am about it. It was the deepest, most meaningful conversation I've ever had. 

K started by giving us his ideas on our personalities (incredibly accurate), and then giving us advice on things hed picked up about us. Then shit turned real and we talked about the space-time continuum etc. 

Before that I thought he was a bit up himself and weird but generally harmless. Now he's a very good friend who's incredibly perceptive and knows a lot more about me than my closer friends do.

Tl;dr; A friend tested mine and 2 other friends reactions to him taking control on a music trip and then gave us a 6 hour run down on his ideas of our personalities that blew our minds.

Incorrect. Decades ago we didn't know anything about pedophilia- everyone (*everyone*) thought it could be cured.

"The problem only occurs (failing mechanical defect) when light-blade based weapons collide. The energy released during such a collision can not transfer from one weapon to the other, so it bounces back and causes heating of the crystals.

It is the constant repeated impacts that cause the early light based weapons to overheat, but this was handled in later weapons by redirecting the reflected energy into a system that regenerates the internal power supply. Before that system was developed, the extra energy was bled off by rapidly twirling the light-blade through the air, allowing excess heat to transfer into the atmospheric gasses. In fact, this was one of the reasons the light sabre was considered a ""primitive"" weapon by many later experts. Jedi / Sith chose to use light sabres specifically because they were so dangerous you had to be insane, or a master of the force, to use them.

Another point: It is typically stated that the final ""test"" for a Jedi is to create his own light sabre. It is probable that Kenobi assumed that Skywalker would not enter into any light sabre duels until he had created his own sabre and become a full Jedi, and was only using Anakin Skywalker's sabre as a training device.

In fact Master Yoda specifically warned Skywalker against confronting Vader until his Jedi training was complete. It is likely that the poor quality weapon was a factor in that warning.",['LucifersCounsel'],0,"Right, but in his training with the lightsaber you would think either he would remark about how hot the saber is getting, or obi-wan would warn him about it.

AWESOME, GLAD THEY REALIZE THIS **AFTER** THE GAME HAS DIED A LOT. NOT LIKE IT WOULD HAVE HELPED FROM THE START OR ANYTHING! GG TRINO....",['ManaPot'],0,"##Producer's Letter: New Year, New Updates!

Greetings ArcheAge Players,

My name is Merv Lee Kwai, also known as ""Khrolan"", and I've recently had the honor of joining the ArcheAge team as a Producer. I became involved with ArcheAge during early Alpha stages and continue to play passionately today. It’s a pleasure to meet you and I know the future is going to be bright with us working together.

Over the past few months in ArcheAge we’ve been fortunate enough to witness your stories unfold. Powerful player alliances have formed and fallen. Newcomers and veterans alike have made their marks on Erenor - hopefully not too many of those marks were made at the bottom of the Arcadian Sea in the form of a shipwreck. We’re proud of how far you’ve come and have exciting news to share about what’s in store for 2015.

One of our top goals for the New Year is to be more transparent when we communicate with you. It is our intention to fix a lack of information or detail, starting now. It’s important for us to reach out and provide the information you need to understand what’s in store for our future and how we’re going to get there. You’ll begin to hear a lot more from us on our forums, social channels and live streams. We will discuss game play issues and provide insight on where we are with future content updates at a much more detailed level then we have in the past. So let’s get started. 

##Along the Shore

Since Auroria’s launch, we’ve seen players combine efforts on a large scale to claim, build and maintain castles. We’ve seen successful sieges and successful siege defenses. War is a difficult undertaking and that’s largely due to the costs to wage battle and the comforts defenders receive. We will spend some time tuning siege mechanics to create a greater sense of risk and a more balanced interaction between competing guilds. 

Serpentis and The Sea of Drowned Love have received a frequent amount of traffic since their release as players compete for their spoils. In order to encourage continued exploration of these dungeons, we have temporarily reduced their barrier to entry by providing easier access, entrance tokens and new quests that grant rewards like Lunadrops, Lunafrosts and temporary duration jewelry upon completion.

We’ve also felt your pain when it comes to deep fluctuation within the game’s economy. Market values of popular items rise and fall based on traditional supply and demand but there are items that have fallen outside of our desired values. Examples of this include the recent spike to regrade components and archeum crystals which ultimately led to some areas of crafting being cost prohibitive. To combat this issue, we will begin to slowly introduce alternative drop methods to the game--reminiscent of the way rumbling archeum saplings influenced the price of thunderstruck trees, but on a much more controlled level. The first way you’ll see this occur is through a login event where you will receive free ""Divine Gifts"" under similar delivery methods as the Winter Maiden’s stockings. These gifts will include various rewards including regrade materials up to Lucky Points.

A decision was reached to make available some of the most popular cosmetic and companion items through the loyalty system in addition to supply crates. This was seen most recently with the addition of the Sloth Glider. Other coveted items will follow this trend and that’s mostly due to player feedback!

##On the Horizon

A main focus for the future of the product is improving the daily quality of life for ArcheAge players. We are shifting priorities to deliver game mechanics that some of the veteran players will recognize like the PvP Arena and Fishing Tournaments. We have a challenge here to ensure that the rewards for these systems are congruent with the way the game has evolved, but that obstacle should be solved in the near term and we will deliver these events as soon as they’re finalized.

Another goal is to review mount and glider normalization to ensure that top tier rewards retain their value. It’s important to us that a reward reflects the level of effort taken to obtain it and we realize that’s not always the case with this category. Normalization has become a bad word of sorts but we believe that’s something we can change through intelligent decisions.

Our future updates will also include an increase to the overall integrity and fairness of the game. Some of these are fundamental changes like adding a global trade channel to remove some of the spam from faction chat, the ability to ignore or refuse mail from blocked senders and even placing a limitation on the number of unbuilt structures a player can maintain simultaneously. You may have also noticed recent efforts to purge players who employ third party programs to gain an advantage while playing Archeage. This is an on-going focus and is necessary to ensure everyone is on an equal playing field.

Over the next couple of weeks you will see the initial stages of the Diamond Shores introduction. For those of you who don’t know, Diamond Shores is a new region that’s located in southwestern Auroria. It’s populated with creatures and quests that are designed to support the level cap increase to 55. It includes a new residential area and is the foundation for the best dungeon experience to date, the Ayanad Library. We’re also excited to see how the introduction of Obsidian Weapons and additional skill points influence the classes you choose to play. Lastly, it’s our Intent to ensure that Diamond Shores goes live as a contested Aurorian region which means open world PvP will be a component of game play in this zone.

##Embarkation

As you can see, we have a multitude of positive changes on the horizon and we extend a hearty thank you to those of you who have provided constructive feedback about the direction in which we should be sailing. Please be sure to stay abreast of new content as it filters through our Public Test Server. We look forward to joining you on the sea in 2015 and watching as the waves you make resonate across Erenor. May your glasses never be empty and the wind always behind your sails… except when turning, that wouldn’t be helpful at all.

Those horses are around 5'4"" or taller at the withers (highest point of the shoulder). They are jumping fences that are around 5'3"" tall.  To jump these fences, the rider has to be out of the saddle, and leaning forward on to the neck of the horse.  The training you have to do to be able to stay like that is intense.  

Plus you also need to be in control of your horse the whole time.  These horses are breed to be big, and they are for the most part, fairly young spirited animals.  So you need to have a lot of muscle and strength just to keep them in check.   

Yes, anyone can sit on a horses back, and probably make it go, but not anyone could do the things these equestrians do.  Yes, I've only covered jumping, but the other events are just as strenuous on the rider, and takes just as much training (or even more in the case of Dressage).

THE ""WHAT IF"" WOULD HAVE BEEN IN A DIRECT RELATING TO THE PARAGRAPH BEFORE IT, STATING THAT WHEN ANCIENT PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT (BY IMPLYING) MAYBE THERE IS A GOD, AND DID THEORIES, AND THAT ATHEISTS ARE DENYING EVEN THE OBLIGATORY ""WHAT IF"", BY SAYING THAT THE THEORIES ARE WRONG.

THEREFORE ME ASKING : EVEN CONSIDERING IF ""GOD NOT EXISTING"" HAS SOME SCIENTIFIC OR LOGICAL HINT OF EVIDENCE, YOU WOULD IMPLY GOD EXISTS TO PROVE THAT EVIDENCE. WHY ARE THEY EVEN REFUSING TO IMPLY HE MAY EXIST, EVEN IF IT MAY LEAD TO A LOT OF THINKING.

JUST LIKE THE SUN THING, YOU TOOK IT OUT OF FRAME AS I MEANT THE LOGIC IS ""SOMETHING IS HIDING THE SUN, WE SAID IT WAS A DRAGON, BUT IT IS THE MOON"" AND THAT IS WHY I SAID THE THEORY BEING WRONG, DOESN'T MEAN THE REASON WHY IT EXISTED IS WRONG. THIS IS WHY AM AGAINST QUOTING.

FOR EXAMPLE, THE BIG BANG, IT IS A THEORY ABOUT THE BEGINNING OF THE KNOWN UNIVERSE, DOES IT HAVE CONCRETE EVIDENCE OTHER THAN LOGIC? HAS IT BEEN TESTED? NO, AND I DEFY YOU TO SAY THE OPPOSITE.
BUT WAIT, DOES THIS MEAN THE WHOLE LOGIC BEHIND IT, THAT IS, ""MAYBE THE UNIVERSE WAS STARTED SOMEWHERE"" IS WRONG? NO.

"&gt; One of the curious paradoxes of game design is that players are terrible at knowing what they will actually enjoy. 

No -- players know if they enjoy something or not. They are terrible at predicting at what they will enjoy and they are also terrible at predicting how to fix problems. Understanding this is key. Reading a gaming article and parroting what you read without understanding it... speaks volumes about you.

&gt; really has to be ignored.

Then I suppose you feel they shouldn't have nerfed ICC when it first came out? And then perhaps the second nerf not too long ago?

If you want to go for the people who feel like spending 6 months trying to down the Lich King and finally succeed and call that a win -- then yes, there are some people who enjoy that. The majority don't enjoy that and will end up giving up on it and losing enjoyment. This game is for entertainment and the goal is to entertain as many as you can as best as you can. This is why the two nerfs have happened in ICC over the year.

Also, just because something revolves around luck doesn't make it hard. It means you have to be lucky. Gamblers love that... other people tend to get bored with it.

&gt; There are no more magic hit cap numbers that have to be looked up

It's worse. Do you go for hit first? What's a good crit amount? As a warlock, should I go for crit or for mastery? None of this is explained.

&gt;  Don't conflate the two.

Being competent requires you to do some quantity of research -- most of which is outside of the game using third party sites such as EJ.",['[deleted]'],0,"&gt; The question is: which is a larger base -- the baddies or the elitists?

No, not really.

The question is: *which game development philosophy will result in more money?*

One of the curious paradoxes of game design is that players are terrible at knowing what they will actually enjoy. Many players will ask for everything to be made easier to so they can beat it, but what they actually enjoy is striving to beat things. They need to know there's something bigger and better out there, waiting to be taken down. The slowest parts in WoW with the least people playing have always been the end-of-expansion blues, when everyone's tired of farming (insert end raid boss here) and they want a new raid to go after, but Blizzard isn't providing.

People will constantly demand the game be made easier, but this is a demand that, in my experience, really has to be ignored.

WoW 4.0 is extremely difficult but surprisingly newbie-friendly. There are no more magic hit cap numbers that have to be looked up - all that stuff is right there in the character sheet. Abilities tell you what they do. It's nearly impossible to catastrophically and unintentionally fuck up your spec. It's more newbie-friendly, and more casual-friendly, than the game has ever been.

And as a final note, ""casual"" and ""incapable"" are two completely different things. There are hardcore players who suck and occasional players who are awesome. Don't conflate the two.",18,18,ZorbaTHut,0

And you also failed to even address the issue of him *lying* about the references to God in the Constitution.  What does *that* have to do with ""political correctness*?

Seriously, it's people like you who make the rest of us not bother engaging in debate.  You *specifically* asked for a source on Ron Paul saying he didn't believe in the separation between church and state.  I provided a link to him saying EXACTLY THAT.  

And now you're trying to stick your fingers in your ears and scream LALALALALA.  Here's a hint: just *saying* something is out of context doesn't make it so or invalidate it.  Unless you plan on arguing that Paul was lying when he said there was no wall between church and state, the context in which he stated this historical belief really does not matter.

I was coming on to a freeway with my big rig, signaling and smoothly switching lanes while keeping half an eye on a car behind me that had been crowding me pretty hard. It was raining. As soon as he hit the merge ramp that he happened to be following me up, he gunned it in an attempt to pass me -- cutting into the no-drive zone (clearly marked as such. It's called the ""gore point"", btw. Trivia). Problem being: My cab is 60' ahead of him. I'm already legally merging, and 50% of my whole rig already occupies the lane he wants. I guess if you have your head in your ass, it's easy to assume that the truck in front of you consists of nothing more than just the final 10' of the trailer. I don't know why, but this dude (and it's almost always a dude that does this) *FLIPS OUT*. He screeches so hard back into his lane that I can literally feel the road tremble. He's blaring his horn, flashing his lights -- and I'm just cruising, calm as fuck. I watch traffic in my drive-side mirror and when I see a break, I suspect what's coming.... Yep. He *jerks* in to the left lane, floors it, gets beside my cab honking the whole way. He serves at me (It's wet out, I do not react. Too dangerous.) and then cuts me off. Meh; expected. Here's the delicious surprise: He jerks into place in front of me, jams his brakes and just totally loses control of his vehicle. It is suddenly *sideways* at 45mph. I'm nowhere near him, having already slowed. As I watch, his car continues to spin until it's facing me, then it whips back forward while heading straight into the ditch, where it plows earth like a farm tool. In front of all of us there on the freeway. I'm stopped, the left lane has stopped and we're just watching as this guy slowly gets out of his car, which looks pretty damaged -- or at least really fucking stuck.

See, everyone wants to ""put their best foot forward"" in the dating game.  The value of a woman has everything to do with her looks.  Displaying cleavage means that she's displaying her full value.  If she covered up while other women showed off, then the other women have an extra advantage at landing the men she wants.

But just like she wants to be competitive, she also prefers guys who are most competitive.  She wants to pick the top guys, the cream of the crop.  And, those top guys are not going to start staring and drooling just because she shows cleavage, because, these are guys who can get hot women with ample cleavage any day - after all, she's after the best, and guys who are the best are easily able to attract women just as attractive as herself.  Because of this, her cleavage alone is simply going to give her a chance with him, but it won't alone make him want her.  She's got to then work hard to do everything else to prove her worth to him.

So the guy she wants is a guy who is pretty much desensitized to pretty women with cleavage.  Being pretty and having cleavage just means that maybe you pass his minimum standards.  It doesn't alone guarantee that he even notices you.  

The fact that you are staring, means that you are not that guy which she wants.  The guy she wants is going to treat her as if he is totally immune to her charms and her attractiveness.",187,187,impotent_rage,0

"Wait, wait, wait... whale FORESKIN seats? Did I hear that right? Is that real???? ",['TacoFury'],0,"As someone who is currently in his 3rd year working in superyachts, all these bridges are dope. However, all of these bridges are from reasonably small yachts. The biggest being the bridge from photo number 2, which looks like it would slot into a 60-80m explorer yacht such as m/y ulysses (http://www.superyachttimes.com/images/3/665/main_568x418.jpg).

A lot of yachts are now using touch screen integration for even sexier bridges. If you want to see some proper pimping bridges look up the yachts from abramovic's fleet. Namely m/y eclipse (~180m)  http://www.giirayachts.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/eclipse.jpg . (a quick search came up with no bridge photos-sorry) I have also heard through the grapevine that m/y octopus (~130m) has a bridge to be admired, not to mention their onboard 4 man submarine.

Small list of other cool shit I have seen on yachts -

""Christina O"" has a swimming pool that can be drained and raised to use as a dance floor, they also have an original renoir painting in the dining room (sorry for the quality, I was on service and had to take a stealth shot http://i.imgur.com/OZeZt.jpg , not to mention whale foreskin seats, with whale teeth sticking out the bases in one of the bars (http://i.imgur.com/bpFim.jpg)- with a photo of winston churchill sitting there.  

S/Y Maltese falcon (http://www.toptenz.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Maltese-Falcon.jpg)has a galley that is gimbled, as in it is suspended on hydraulic arms, so the boat essentially moves around it. Meaning it is dead flat in the galley, even though the boat may be heeling heavily.

If I'd cut a cable short, I'd be stressing about it for three days.  He's just *fun* to be around with, and so oblivious of his good looks and charm that you can't help but like him.  He makes music videos featuring him skateboarding in his po-dunk little town, and amateurish as they are, because he's in them it looks like they're almost like a professional director going for the home video look.",765,765,defeatedbird,0
